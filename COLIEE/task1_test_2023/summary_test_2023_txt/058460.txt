The plaintiff's claim was dismissed for delay in 1999 and the defendants sought an award of their costs. The court initially indicated that it was not usual to award costs when the dismissal of a claim resulted from the court's initiative but the defendants argued that they had incurred expenses in responding to various motions. The court ultimately concluded that the defendants should recover their costs from the plaintiff and the amount paid into court by the plaintiff should be used to compensate them. An order to that effect was issued.
