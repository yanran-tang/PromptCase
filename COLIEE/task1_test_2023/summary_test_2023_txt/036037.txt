anent resident in Canada involves three classes of immigrants: family economic and refugee. In this case Mr. Homayoun Vaziri is attempting to bring his father to Canada as a permanent resident. However delays and restrictions on processing parent and grandparent sponsorship applications have caused him to seek an order of mandamus requiring the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to render a decision. The key issues revolve around the Minister's legal authority to establish targets for visa approvals and to prioritize sponsored applications within the family class. The court's analysis and conclusions will likely have implications for other parents and grandparents waiting for sponsored permanent residence in Canada.The process for a sponsored application involves two steps: the sponsor must submit a sponsorship application which is processed by CIC's Case Processing Centre and if approved the individual seeking to come to Canada must submit an application for permanent residence which is processed at overseas visa offices. Delay in processing such applications is due to high demand and operational capacity constraints. Mr. Homayoun Vaziri's sponsorship application was caught in a temporary pause due to reduced targets for sponsored parents and grandparents. The sponsorship application was approved in October 2005 and Mr. Hassan Vaziri's application for permanent residence is expected to be finalized in early 2007.The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is responsible for setting targets and policies for accepting permanent residency applications in Canada. These decisions are supported by operational decisions by the Minister and carried out by CIC officials. The Applicants argue that these decisions are not being lawfully made. The Minister's authority to make such decisions is set out in s. 4 of IRPA and specific regulation-making authority is contained in s. 14.
