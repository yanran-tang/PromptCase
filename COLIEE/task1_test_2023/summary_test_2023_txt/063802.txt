The case concerns the appeal of Syed Mohammad Arif's application for Canadian citizenship which was denied by a judge for failing to meet the residency requirements under subsection 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act. Arif was physically present in Canada for at least three out of the four years before his application but failed to report any income for his 2003 and 2004 taxation years indicating a failure to fulfill his responsibilities as a resident. The judge's decision was upheld on the basis of the facts and the applicable legal tests.
