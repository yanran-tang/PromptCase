The issue of a question of law respecting onus and the imposition of directions were dismissed and are now under appeal. The presiding Justice was of the view that the matters in dispute should be resolved by way of the judicial review process in light of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations. Regulations 6 and 7 prohibit the Minister from issuing a notice of compliance until such time as the patent expires or that the court declares either that the allegations submitted are not justified. The court believes that each situation will require lengthy trials and viva voce evidence and directs that these applications proceed by way of an action in accordance with s. 18.4(2) of the Federal Court Act.
