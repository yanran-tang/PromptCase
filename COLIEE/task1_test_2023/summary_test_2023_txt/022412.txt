The applicant was a police officer in El Salvador who deserted due to threats from the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and sought refugee status in Canada. The Immigration and Refugee Board initially refused the claim but the Federal Court of Appeal overturned the decision stating that the evidence did not support a conclusion that would remove the objective basis for the applicant's fear of persecution. The case was remanded for a redetermination taking into account changed circumstances.
