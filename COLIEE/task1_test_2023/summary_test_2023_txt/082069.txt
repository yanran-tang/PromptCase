The applicants seek judicial review of the Minister of Agriculture's refusal to accept responsibility for eradicating and preventing the spread of North American Gypsy Moth in British Columbia. The decision to withdraw from eradication efforts was motivated by cost concerns and a decision of the British Columbia Environmental Appeal Board and was taken after consultations between the Minister and senior officials of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. CFIA officials recommended further steps to develop a new NAGM policy including consultations with the BC Ministry of Forests.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) recommended a change in strategy regarding the eradication of the North American gypsy moth in British Columbia due to the high cost of ongoing eradication efforts and setbacks caused by the refusal of necessary permits for aerial spraying. The CFIA proposed implementing a zone management strategy and placing responsibility for eradication on the province or industry with certification programs for infested and non-infested areas. The province requested that CFIA continue funding eradication efforts but CFIA recommended a short-term strategy instead.The Canadian government spent over $2.5 million over the last 20 years to eradicate North American gypsy moth in British Columbia. A comprehensive study on Domestic Quarantine Pest eradication/funding was recommended and the CFIA established regulated areas in B.C. to continue market access. A one-time federal contribution of $80000 was also given to assist with the transition.
