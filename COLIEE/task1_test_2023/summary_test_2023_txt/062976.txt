In a tax appeal case referred to as Speedy Muffler the plaintiff claimed that its activities of assembling and installing exhaust systems on motor vehicles constituted an active business of manufacturing and processing goods for sale in Canada granting them tax allowances and deductions. However the court found that the work carried out by Speedy Muffler did not constitute the manufacturing or processing of goods for sale but instead constituted services. Additionally as the exhaust parts installed under the vehicles of customers were not sold to them but had become their property by accession the activities would not be considered in respect of goods for sale.
