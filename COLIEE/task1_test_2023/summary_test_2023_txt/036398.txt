The case involves an application for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act S.C. 2001 c. 27 of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (panel) that the applicant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act. The panel found that the applicant was not credible and did not persuade it that the Mexican state could not protect her and decided that there was an internal flight alternative (IFA) for the applicant in the cities of Tijuana Guadalajara Monterrey and Cancun. The court dismissed the application for judicial review.
