Estardai Beharry and her two children filed an application for a Pre-removal Risk Assessment claiming they would be in danger if they returned to Guyana due to a brutal home invasion. The PRRA Officer concluded that adequate state protection would be provided despite evidence of increasing violent crime. The judge found this decision unreasonable concluding the evidence did not support a finding of adequate state protection. The matter was remitted to a different PRRA Officer for re-determination. No serious question of general importance was certified.
