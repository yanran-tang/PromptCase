The plaintiff H. Smith Packing Corporation filed an application to the Federal Court to strike out the defence of Hub Forwarding Company Inc. and enter judgment against them due to their failure to comply with court rules and orders. The defendant had not produced a list of documents as requested and showed a pattern of delaying the litigation. Madame Justice Reed ordered the defendant to provide the required documents and set a schedule for discovery examinations but the defendant failed to comply. The plaintiff requested costs on a solicitor/client basis.The case involves a dispute over the production of documents in accordance with court rules. The defendant Hub Forwarding filed a list of documents in November 1990 but during discovery in January 1991 it was revealed that not all documents had been provided. Further complications arose due to changes in the Federal Court rules relating to discovery and production of documents. Counsel for the defendant eventually filed an affidavit verifying a list of documents in March 1991.
