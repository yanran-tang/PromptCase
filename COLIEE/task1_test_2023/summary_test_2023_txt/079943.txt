In a statement of claim filed in 1997 plaintiff Gibson sued defendants for misappropriation of groundfish fishery quota originally assigned to a vessel named Gypsy Lass. The plaintiff claimed damages and injunctions against the defendants including transfer of the quota and condemnation of the Steadfast vessel. The interim injunction was extended and continued on consent for an indefinite term. The defendants also filed their statement of defence and counterclaims.On October 1 1997 a court ruled that the issue of in rem jurisdiction in a legal case was a priority issue with all relevant documents to be filed by October 25 and a hearing to take place the week of November 19. However a motion filed by the Mark defendants on November 10 seeking to rescind and set aside an injunction effectively preempted the jurisdictional issue hearing. The motion also requested an award of solicitor and client costs and a reference to determine the damages caused by the injunction. The motion was to be heard on November 17 1997.In 1997 there was a court case where an injunction was issued against the use of a groundfish quota. The injunction was extended a few times and eventually was lifted by a court order issued on November 25th. There were a few teleconferences between the parties involved in the case but ultimately an interim solution was not reached.
