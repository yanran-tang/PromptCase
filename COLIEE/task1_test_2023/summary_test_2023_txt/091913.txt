This case is about an application for judicial review of a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision that ruled on discriminatory practices in employment on the basis of national or ethnic origin. The applicant was a Sikh of East Indian origin who had been unable to secure a position commensurate with his qualifications and experience with a regulatory authority due to his ethnicity. The issue on this review was whether the correct remedy was imposed by the Tribunal and whether compensation should be awarded for loss of opportunity for employment.The case involves the rejection of Dr. Sangha an immigrant from India with a Ph.D. for an entry-level position as a regulatory officer due to being overqualified. The Northwest Territories Board denied any discrimination and said that his educational qualifications did not match the job's scope and the Board screened out all applicants with only a Grade 12 education and those with post-graduate degrees.The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal found that the applicant Dr. Sangha had been discriminated against when he was not hired for a position with the Northwest Territories Power Corporation. The Tribunal found that the Board's decision not to hire Dr. Sangha was based on his overqualification and that this had a greater impact on visible minority immigrant candidates. The Board failed to refute the correlation between overqualified status and visible minority immigrant status.
