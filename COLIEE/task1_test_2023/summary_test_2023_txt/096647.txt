Lundbeck Canada's owner of a Canadian patent for a drug is seeking a protective order against Genpharm a Canadian generic pharmaceutical company who has filed for a notice of compliance for a medicinal ingredient that the patent covers. Lundbeck is seeking to prevent serious risk to their commercial interests by having the court issue a confidentiality order. Similar proceedings are taking place in the UK and Australia.The court will only provide a view on an appropriate form of order when the parties disagree. Lundbeck and Genpharm agree to produce their relevant portions with confidentiality agreements. Lundbeck's proposed order includes filing documents already disclosed and those not disclosed with restricted access for certain individuals excluding Genpharm Generics and Taylor. Genpharm takes issue with the restricted confidential information category and wishes to have access to this information. Lundbeck argues that employees of Generics should not have access to confidential information.
