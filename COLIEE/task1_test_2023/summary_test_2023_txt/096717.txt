The applicant seeks to have his deportation order stayed pending the outcome of his appeal against the decision that there was no credible basis to his claim for Convention refugee status. The respondent argues that the court has no jurisdiction to grant a stay as the applicant does not challenge the validity of the deportation order. However the court finds that a challenge to the decision finding no credible basis indirectly challenges the validity of the deportation order. The court grants the stay as the applicant has an arguable case would suffer irreparable harm if a stay was not granted and the balance of convenience lies with the applicant.
