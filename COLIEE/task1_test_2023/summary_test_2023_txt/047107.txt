The Applicants Ms. Nadiath Radji and her daughter Leyla Apithy seek a stay of their removal order to the United States until their application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds is disposed of. The underlying application challenges the decision of the H&C Officer to refuse their request. The Court applies a tri-partite test to determine whether a stay should be granted and concludes that the Applicants have not demonstrated irreparable harm.The Applicants are seeking a judicial stay to prevent their removal from Canada based on the tri-partite test established by the Federal Court of Appeal. The Applicants argue that the H&C Officer erred in assessing the best interests of their child in their application. However the Court found that the Officer properly evaluated the best interests of the child and the Applicants have failed to show that the decision was unreasonable. Therefore the Court denied their request for a stay order.
