The case concerns a family of Mexican citizens who arrived in Canada seeking protection claiming persecution in Mexico by the principal applicant's former partner and her associates. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) determined that adequate state protection existed in Mexico and a viable internal flight alternative in Guadalajara was available. The Federal Court dismissed the application for judicial review finding that the RPD's decision was reasonable and made without error and declined to certify any questions of general importance.
