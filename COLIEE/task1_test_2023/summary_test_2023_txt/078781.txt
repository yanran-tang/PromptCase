A family facing allegations of smuggling goods worth $6 billion and other charges in China claimed refugee status in Canada in 2000 but the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) subsequently excluded the parents from claiming refugee status. The Board found the family to be criminals fleeing justice and rejected their claims that they were victims of a cover-up and conspiracy. The family then applied for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act which the children's PRRA officer rejected. The children contested the PRRA officer’s decision and claimed they would be at risk from the government and the public if returned to China. The Federal Court granted the children's application for judicial review and ordered redetermination by a different officer.
