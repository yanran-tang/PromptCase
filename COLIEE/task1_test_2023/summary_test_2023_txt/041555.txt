The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) denied nine applicants' request for the re-issuance of shrimp licenses. The applicants seek a mandatory injunction to compel the DFO to issue a shrimp license to each applicant for the purpose of transfer. The applicants had previously participated in the Groundfish Licence Retirement Program (GLRP) which required the surrender of all commercial fishing licenses and permanently exiting the fishery. The Newfoundland and Labrador region implemented different rules from other DFO administrative regions requiring the surrender of all commercial fishing licenses as a condition of participation in the GLRP.The Canadian Department of Fisheries refused to reissue shrimp licenses to fishers who had surrendered them under the Groundfish Licence Retirement Program. The program required participants to surrender all commercial fishing licenses exit the commercial fishery and forego further income support benefits. The department argued that no individual could claim an interest in a license to fish and that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans retained absolute discretion whether or not to issue a fishing license.
