Gulzar Ahmed a citizen of Pakistan and a member of the Shia community applied for refugee status in Canada claiming persecution by the extremist Sunni Muslim group Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP). Mr. Ahmed had been threatened physically attacked and his business had been vandalized due to his involvement in a peaceful Shia organization. The Canada Federal Court denied his application for refugee status finding that his circumstances did not meet the criteria for designation as either a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.Mr. Ahmed a Shia Muslim tailoring business owner in Pakistan claimed that he was persecuted by the Sunni extremist group Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) and the police because of his religious beliefs. However the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada rejected his claim citing lack of credibility and inconsistencies in his testimony. The Board noted that Ahmed was unable to provide evidence for the existence of his business and gave little weight to a letter from the Anjuman President submitted by Mr. Ahmed that described his problems with the SSP and the police.
