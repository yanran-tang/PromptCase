This is a case of Majid Rafieyan an Iranian citizen who fled to Canada with his family and was granted refugee status in 1995. However in 1996 he was arrested and convicted of assaulting his wife and in 1997 he violently stabbed her and was convicted of attempted murder. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and in 1999 he was ordered to be deported. Despite his serious criminal background he applied for a visa exemption based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations but it was rejected by the immigration officer.A man submitted an application for permanent residency based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations which was denied in 2004. He requested a judicial review and the court set aside the previous decision due to failure to consider risks if the applicant was removed to Iran. However when the officer reviewed the case again in 2006 he denied the application stating that the applicant would not suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship if removed to Iran. The case raises questions about admissibility of new affidavits consideration of evidence violation of procedural fairness and the standard of review.
