The defendants in a case raised the issue of the jurisdiction of a prothonotary to strike out a pleading under rule 419(1) of the Federal Court Rules. The judge determined that prothonotaries do have jurisdiction to decide applications pursuant to rule 419(1) and that this decision would apply to all cases. The judge also considered the merits of the appeal and concluded that the statement of claim should not be struck out as it establishes a possible cause of action.
