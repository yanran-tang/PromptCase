The case involves judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board that denied the Minister's application to discontinue the respondent's appeal and deportation order. The IAD dismissed the Minister's application because the respondent did not receive a term of imprisonment of more than two years as required by section 64(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The court found that the IAD erred in not considering pre-sentence custody as part of the term of imprisonment and remitted the matter for rehearing.
