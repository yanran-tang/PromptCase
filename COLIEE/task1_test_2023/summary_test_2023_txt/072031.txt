The Principal Applicant A.C. and his wife B.D. have sought judicial review of a decision by a panel of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board that they are not Convention refugees. A.C. a citizen of Bangladesh was found guilty of involvement in the 1975 coup that resulted in the death of the president of Bangladesh and members of his family. A.C. denies his involvement and claims that his criticism of the previous regime led to his forced resignation in 1974 after which he set up a company involved in importing and marketing various products.The Principal Applicant a former member of the Bangladesh military was found guilty of criminal offences related to the assassination of the country's president in 1975 and was sentenced to death by firing squad. His appeal for the case was still pending at the time of the hearing. The Panel determined that the Principal Applicant was not a Convention refugee nor in need of protection as he had committed a serious non-political crime and was excluded under Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. The Panel also concluded that he was a fugitive from justice fearing prosecution rather than persecution.Anel found that the wife of the Principal Applicant was not subject to exclusions under Article 1F(a) and (b) of the Convention but also concluded that she had no claim to Refugee status in her own right as she no longer had a well founded fear of persecution. The Applicants raised multiple issues including whether the Panel ignored evidence and erred in its determination that the Principal Applicant was excluded from protection. The appropriate standard of review for the Decision of the Panel was considered with a high level of deference generally shown towards decisions of the Panel.
