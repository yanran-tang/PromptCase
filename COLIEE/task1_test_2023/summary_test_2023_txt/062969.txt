s incident to the police but no action was taken. The Applicant fears that if she returns to Brazil Silva's power and connections will prevent her from receiving adequate protection from the state. The Refugee Protection Division accepted the Applicant's evidence but did not grant protection on the basis that she failed to rebut the presumption that the state of Brazil could protect her if she returned. However the decision was found to be in reviewable error and the matter will be sent back for re-determination. The Applicant argues that the RPD's determination on the issue of state protection is in reviewable error due to the incorrect application of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Ward.The Federal Court of Appeals in Canada has overturned a decision rejecting the asylum claim of a woman who claimed to have suffered domestic violence in Brazil stating that the previous decision did not properly take into account the woman's fear of persecution and should not have relied on the assumption that the Brazilian government could protect its citizens in all cases. The court also criticised the original decision as being overly reliant on the woman's failure to seek medical attention despite her access to counselling and support through local NGOs and her inability to obtain documentation or evidence of her police reports.In two legal cases Ward and an unnamed case Canadian courts considered the need for claimants to show they were unable to get protection from their own government in order to be considered refugees. In Ward the court ruled that a lack of government control meant there was no protection available and in the unnamed case the court considered the inability of a government to fully protect its citizens from terrorist threats.
