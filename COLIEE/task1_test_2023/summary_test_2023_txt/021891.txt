The case of Larrissan Tsongo v. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Du Canada (IMM-8664-03) involved an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (panel) which determined that the applicant was not a Convention refugee. The panel dismissed the applicant's refugee claim based on her failure to establish her identity and lack of credibility. The Court found no errors in the panel's decision and therefore dismissed the application for judicial review. No questions were certified.
