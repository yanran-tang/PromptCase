The case involves an application for judicial review of the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) decision which failed to recognize the applicants as Convention refugees based on their alleged well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine where they were receiving harassment and discrimination on the grounds of the male applicant's religion Judaism. The decision emphasized the issue of state protection and concluded that the applicants did not present sufficient clear and convincing evidence of state inability to protect them. The court dismissed the application and certified a question on evidence of persecution after seeking state protection.
