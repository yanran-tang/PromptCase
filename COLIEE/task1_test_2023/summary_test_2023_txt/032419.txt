The Ontario Court of Justice heard a case involving the interpretation of s. 31 of the Income Tax Act in November 1984. Similar issues were also addressed in another case heard by Joyal J. in the Federal Court of Appeal. Despite prior consideration by the Supreme Court of Canada confusion still existed with the interpretation of the convoluted language of s. 31. The issue was due to an apparent contradiction in terms where the section only applied to years with losses from farming operations but required an assessment of the significance of the taxpayer's farm income in relation to other sources. The full text of s. 31 was provided in the statement.In 1979 the Income Tax Act was amended to substitute certain clauses which were the subject of a legal dispute in the case of Graham. The dissenting judge noted that the case raised the question of whether a person who starts a farming operation while still employed can be regarded as having made farming their chief source of income under section 31 of the Act before they have developed an operation that can yield a profit. The judge argued that for the determination to be meaningful actual and not just projected income must be considered.
