Tucumcari Aero challenged the decision of the Registrar of Trade-marks to expunge its trade-mark registration for the Moto Mirror and Design trade-mark used for truck and automobile mirrors. The Registrar's decision was upheld due to ambiguity over Tucumcari's control over the quality of those mirrors under an unspecified licensing arrangement. However additional evidence submitted in the form of an affidavit by a Vice-President helped clarify the issue of control allowing for the indirect control by Tucumcari to be established and the registration to be amended to remove the reference to automobile mirrors.
