Mahmood Ali Shah a 54-year-old Ahmadi Muslim from Pakistan appealed a decision by the Refugee Protection Division denying his claim to be a convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Shah feared persecution due to his religious activities in Pakistan which included harassment threats and physical violence by local Sunni imam Mr. Murtaza and his associates. The Board rejected Shah's claim for refugee status stating that his behaviour was not consistent with a well-founded fear of persecution as he delayed his departure from Pakistan after the harassment began. However the Court found the Board's reasons to be insufficient and allowed the appeal sending the matter back for a re-consideration with a differently constituted panel.
