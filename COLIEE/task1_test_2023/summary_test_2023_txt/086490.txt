Safraz Vickram a successful businessman from Guyana claimed refugee status in Canada after being threatened beaten and harassed by a group of bandits. The Immigration and Refugee Board ultimately rejected his claim finding that the acts of violence against him were not linked to his ethnicity and that he would not face a risk to life if returned to Guyana. The Federal Court upheld the Board's decision finding that it was not made without regard to the evidence before it.
