The plaintiff alleges that the defendants infringed their copyright in a velvet fabric design called Classic 763 by producing inferior quality fabric with the same design and using it to make girls' dresses sold in Canada in 1993 and 1994. The plaintiff seeks a declaration of copyright ownership infringement a permanent injunction delivery of infringing materials accounting of profits and costs. The defendants argue there is insufficient evidence to prove copyright infringement and seek summary dismissal of the action with costs.The court case pertains to the ownership of the copyright of an artistic work. The plaintiff claims that they acquired the copyright from the artist Marie Loris who created the artwork in question. However no written assignment of copyright has been registered under the Copyright Act and the defendant contests the validity of the plaintiff's claim. The court must determine the author of the work and whether the plaintiff has sufficient evidence to prove ownership of the copyright.
