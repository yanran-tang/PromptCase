The case involves a motion for judicial review to quash a decision approving the construction of a bridge and causeway by Ronald Morash in St. Margaret's Bay. The applicant objected to the construction and requested an extension of time and the opportunity for a fair hearing but their objections were not given proper consideration. The Court ruled that the Director General had breached their duty of fairness and quashed the decision. The applicant was awarded costs.
