The Ministry of Commerce and Industry of Cyprus appeals three decisions by the Registrar of Trade-Marks that dismissed the application for registration of the certification mark of HALLOUMI cheese. Three oppositions from les Producteurs Laitiers du Canada Agropur Coop√©rative Agro-Alimentaire and the International Cheese Council of Canada were upheld.he trade mark case involving the use of the term HALLOUMI the Applicant was denied registration of the mark pursuant to various sections of the Canadian Trade-marks Act. The opposition to the application was filed by les Producteurs Laitiers and Agropur and the Cheese Council also submitted evidence. Both parties were cross-examined and the hearing was held in 2008 before the Registrar refused the Applicant's application for registration.In a trademark case involving the registration of halloumi the Registrar rejected most of the Cheese Council's grounds of opposition as they failed to provide evidence to support their claim. However the Registrar admitted that an opponent could rely on an applicant's evidence to argue compliance issues. Although satisfied with the use of the mark the Registrar found that the applicant did not prove it was the authority that issued licences authorizing its use and therefore the opponents had met their initial burden.
