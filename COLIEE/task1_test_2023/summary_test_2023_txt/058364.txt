The applicants sought judicial review of the Convention Refugee Determination Division's decision to deny their application for refugee status. The Board erred in failing to consider the possibility of political persecution related to the extortion suffered by the applicants in Columbia which was used to determine their political allegiance. The application for judicial review was granted and the matter was returned for redetermination by a different panel of the Board.
