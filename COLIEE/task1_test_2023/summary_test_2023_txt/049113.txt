This is an application for a judicial review seeking to set aside a decision made by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to dismiss a complaint made by the applicant alleging discrimination in employment on the grounds of race national or ethnic origin and colour. The applicant argued that the investigation report did not address all the evidence and that the Commission should have appointed a Human Rights Tribunal. However the court found that there was no evidence that the Commission did not consider all the evidence before making its decision and the application was dismissed with costs against the applicant.
