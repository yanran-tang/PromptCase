The case involves an application for refugee status from a Cuban citizen who claims to be persecuted by the Cuban authorities due to her association with a Canadian citizen. The Refugee Protection Division denied her claim due to a lack of credibility with her subjective fear of persecution. The applicant sought judicial review alleging breach of natural justice disclosure failure and errors in the decision. The court concluded that the absence of a transcript did not deprive the applicant of a ground for judicial review and her explanations for delay and return to Cuba were not accepted as reasonable.
