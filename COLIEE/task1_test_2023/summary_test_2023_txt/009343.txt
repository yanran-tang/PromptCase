An inmate at Warkworth Institution in Ontario Canada has applied for writs of certiorari and mandamus after his application to participate in the Private Family Visiting Program was refused due to his same-sex partner. The applicant argues that this denial is a violation of his rights under s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which states that every individual is equal before and under the law without discrimination and he has been denied a benefit available to other heterosexual inmates. The court agrees and orders the Commissioner of the Correctional Service to reconsider the applicant's grievance in accordance with s. 15.
