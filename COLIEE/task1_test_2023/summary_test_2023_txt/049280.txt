Edmond Bojaj a 19-year-old citizen of Albania applied for leave and judicial review of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board. Bojaj claimed a well-founded fear of persecution due to a blood feud between his family and the Curri family which resulted in his grandfather’s murder of a member of the Curri family. However the Board found that Bojaj’s fear of revenge and murder was a problem of criminality and not persecution based on a Convention reason. The application for judicial review was dismissed but the question of whether young men targeted for death under the Canon of Leke can form a particular social group in the definition of Convention refugee was certified.
