The plaintiff appealed reassessments by the Minister of National Revenue of its income for the 1982-1985 taxation years. The Minister disallowed the plaintiff's claimed deductions for manufacturing and processing tax credit investment tax credits and capital cost allowance on assets. The dispute arose from the plaintiff's involvement in providing processed radiographic film to a medical partnership's practice of radiology. Prior to 1979 the partnership owned all equipment and employees but in 1979 the company was formed to take over the equipment and employ the technologists. In 1981 the company changed its name and entered into an agreement with the partnership to supply processed radiographic film.In a tax case the Court must determine whether radiology firm Radiology Associates is eligible for certain tax credits under the Income Tax Act. The firm argues that it was in the business of processing and selling X-Ray and ultrasound films. However the defendant argues that the firm was actually providing services to patients and the partnership. The Court ultimately agrees with the defendant ruling that Radiology Associates was not processing goods for sale and therefore not eligible for tax credits.
