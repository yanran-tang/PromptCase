The court is considering whether to dismiss the plaintiffs' case due to delays in complying with court orders. The plaintiffs filed a statement of claim in 1995 but delays in filing required documents led to a notice of status review in 1999 at which time the court established a schedule for moving forward. Despite representations from the plaintiffs that they would comply they did not meet the deadlines set forth in the court order prompting the court to consider dismissing the case.
