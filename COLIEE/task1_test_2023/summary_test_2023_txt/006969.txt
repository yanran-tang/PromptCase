Abbott Laboratories sought an order to stop the Minister of National Health and Welfare from issuing a Notice of Compliance to Nu-Pharm Inc. regarding their version of epileptic seizure drug divalproex sodium. This was due to Canadian letters patent 1136151 not expiring until November 23 1999. Nu-Pharm used a process that Abbott claimed infringed on their patent.Abbott's patent covers a process for making divalproex sodium which involves dissolving sodium valproate and valproic acid in acetone and precipitating the product. Nu-Pharm argues that their process which uses only valproic acid as a solvent at a higher process temperature is an obvious variation and therefore not infringing. Both parties have expert opinions supporting their position. The dispute revolves around whether the use of acetone is essential to the patent or not.Nu-Pharm is accused by Abbott of infringing a patent for the production of divalproex sodium. Nu-Pharm claims that their production method does not infringe the patent as it does not use acetone a key feature of the patent and that their method was not obvious to skilled artisans when the patent was invented. Nu-Pharm supports their claim with arguments of chemical differences and cost efficiency safety and environmental advantages. The court must determine if Nu-Pharm's method is an obvious chemical equivalent of the patent.
