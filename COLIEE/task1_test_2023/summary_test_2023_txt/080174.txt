The case involves an applicant from Belarus who applied for Canadian permanent residency as an Electrical and Electronics Engineer but was refused due to doubts about his work experience and authenticity of references provided. The visa officer concluded that the applicant lacked the required 70 points under the regulations and therefore the visa was refused. The court found that the visa officer did not make any material errors warranting the court's intervention and the application for judicial review was dismissed.
