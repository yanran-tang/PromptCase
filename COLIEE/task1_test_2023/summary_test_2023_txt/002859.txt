The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board to grant an appeal from a visa officer's decision to refuse the permanent residency application made by a spouse. The court finds that the Board erred in assessing the genuineness of the relationship only through the respondent's version of events or intentions and disregarding contradictory testimony. The matter is referred back to the Board for re-determination by other members.
