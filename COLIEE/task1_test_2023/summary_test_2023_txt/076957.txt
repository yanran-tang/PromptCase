The appeal concerns a motion by the defendant Techno-Bloc Inc. to declare that the plaintiffs' counsel be disqualified from representing them due to a conflict of interest arising from confidential information allegedly exchanged during meetings between the defendant's vice-president and a patent agent from Robic who is a member of the plaintiffs' counsel's law firm. The prothonotary's decision that the information exchanged was in the public domain and that the plaintiffs' counsel was not in a conflict of interest is being challenged by the defendant.tal principles in determining if a lawyer has a conflict of interest: the obligation to maintain the high standards and integrity of the legal profession and justice system and the importance of allowing reasonable mobility in the legal profession. The use of confidential information is also a critical factor with the burden of proving no misuse resting on the lawyer in question. The court assumes that the principles outlined in the Martin case apply to the current case as well. The confidentiality of solicitor-client communications is of utmost significance in preserving the trust between lawyers and clients and the administration of justice as a whole.
