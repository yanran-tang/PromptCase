ants fled Israel and sought refugee status in Canada. However the Refugee Division denied their application finding that they did not meet the definition of Convention refugees. The applicants then filed an application for judicial review asking the court to overturn the decision. The court is now considering the case. The applicants allege persecution on the basis of their Ukrainian nationality and Christian faith in Israel but the Refugee Division found that the incidents did not rise to the level of persecution that would qualify them for refugee protection.ouple's refugee claim showed that there was a possibility of persecution. However the Refugee Division considered the evidence provided and concluded that there was no serious possibility of persecution if the applicants returned to Israel. The panel noted that the State of Israel guarantees freedom of religion and provides financial assistance housing and language courses to all returnees regardless of their religion or nationality. Additionally the panel found that the applicants had not presented any clear and convincing rebuttal evidence to support their claim.
