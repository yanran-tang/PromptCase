The case involves a claim by plaintiffs who allege they have been members of the Ermineskin Indian Band since 1937 but their names were unjustly removed in 1944 denying them benefits. The Ermineskin defendants argue the court has no jurisdiction to issue monetary relief against them for breach of fiduciary duty nor do they owe a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs. The court has denied the Ermineskin defendants' motion to strike the plaintiffs' claim.
