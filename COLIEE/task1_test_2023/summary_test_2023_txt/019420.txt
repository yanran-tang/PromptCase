. 225.1(5) allows for an agent to sign on behalf of the taxpayer such authority must be explicitly given by the taxpayer; and (3) the Minister cannot delegate the powers under s. 225.1(5) to department officials. The decision in this case will have implications for whether an agent has the authority to sign an abeyance agreement and whether the Minister can delegate their powers under s. 225.1(5).Mr. Doyle's appeal against Revenue Canada's disallowance of the deductions he had claimed in his 1984 tax return was dismissed by the court due to technical reasons. The court stated that the abeyance agreement was invalid because it wasn't signed by the Minister and even if it was it would still be ineffective as it was not signed by the taxpayer. However the court acknowledged that Mr. Doyle had authorized Thill to act as his agent and Thill had the authority to sign the abeyance letter on his behalf.
