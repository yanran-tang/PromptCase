The applicant is seeking an order to quash the Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision to delay the processing of her discrimination complaint until the outcome of another case involving similar issues. The applicant claims that this delay is unlawful and unjust. The applicant's counsel argues that the Commission's decision is outside its legal authority and requests an order compelling the Commission to process the complaint without delay.The applicant was an employee of the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission and a member of a bargaining unit represented by the Public Service Alliance of Canada. She was required to join the Public Service Dental Care Plan but her request to include her common-law partner was denied based on the definition of spouse in the master agreement. She filed a complaint of discrimination with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.In 1990 a Canadian woman filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission against her employer Employment and Immigration Canada and two other organizations alleging discrimination on several grounds. Despite objections from the woman's counsel the complaint was held in abeyance pending the outcome of a similar case before the Federal Court of Appeal and later pending the decision of the Supreme Court. Ultimately the Commission decided to stand down the complaint. The case highlights the challenges and delays faced by complainants in navigating the Canadian human rights system.
