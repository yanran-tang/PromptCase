The case involves an application for judicial review of a Canada Labour Code decision made by an adjudicator awarding seven monthsâ€™ pay in lieu of notice to a complainant for unjust dismissal. The complainant was a truck driver for the applicant and despite attempts to contact management for a salary increase there was no response until after she had returned from medical leave. The applicant requested the decision be set aside and the matter referred back to a new adjudicator.The letter from employee Shelly Lesy to her employer Shane Lincoln expresses dissatisfaction with her job and requests a response suggesting that she may pursue other opportunities. In response Lincoln contacted Lesy and two witnesses attest to a civil conversation though Lesy describes Lincoln as aggressive and using profanities. Lesy then sent a second letter demanding compensation and a raise in order to consider staying but Lincoln felt the relationship had come to an end due to Lesy's demeaning comments towards management and a major client.In this case the respondent's employment was terminated without reason given leading to an appeal under the Canada Labour Code. The adjudicator found that the respondent did not resign and was terminated for insubordination due to her negative letters and refusal to apologize. The adjudicator agreed that disciplinary action was warranted but questioned if the termination was appropriate.
