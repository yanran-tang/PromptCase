The International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Marine Section) Local 400 is seeking judicial review of a decision by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal upholding a complaint by Helen Oster that the Union had discriminated against her on grounds of sex. Oster claimed that the Union president David Crain had been informed that she was not suitable for a position because the vessel did not have separate sleeping quarters for women. The Tribunal's initial decision ruled in Oster's favor.This passage discusses a case where a woman Ms. Oster was not referred for a job as a cook/deckhand on a tug due to the lack of separate sleeping accommodations for women. She filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission which led to an inquiry by the Tribunal. The Tribunal found that there was discrimination and criticized the Union's conduct. However the case is not about forcing people to share sleeping accommodations with members of the opposite sex.The Respondent in the case failed to provide evidence that the standard they adopted was rationally connected to the function being performed or adopted in good faith. There was no evidence that allowing a woman to participate in the six-hour opposite shift would interfere with the rights of other employees. The Respondent had an obligation not to be a party to a discriminatory act and they failed to respond in a consistent manner with their obligation to accommodate the Complainant.
