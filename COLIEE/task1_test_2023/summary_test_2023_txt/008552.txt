The Fisheries Council of British Columbia seeks to intervene in a legal dispute in which the Yale Indian Band challenges the right of the Minister of Fisheries to issue an aboriginal communal salmon fishing license. The dispute relates to who has the right to fish in a specific area on either side of Yale using traditional fishing methods with the Yale Band claiming the area as its traditional territory. The Fisheries Council must prove it has a legitimate interest and can bring unique insights to the case to be allowed to intervene.The Yale First Nation claims aboriginal rights and title to a salmon fishery in the Fraser River near Yale. The Lower Fraser Bands contest their right and title to the fishery and claim they have joint tenure to use the river. The issue has arisen due to a communal fishing license granted to the First Nations of the Lower Fraser allowing them to fish in the area claimed by the Yale Band. The Yale Band seeks a review of the communal fishing license for May 1998 and a prohibition against their issuance in the future.
