This is a case of a Rwandan citizen Faustin Rutayisire seeking judicial review of his inadmissibility to Canada due to his involvement in the genocide of Tutsis during his position as sub-prefect of Butare. While the court found that Butare was not a limited brutal purpose organization Rutayisire was still considered complicit in crimes against humanity due to his administrative role during the genocide. Despite his claims of being appointed against his will Rutayisire's duties as sub-prefect included technical economic and administrative work that allowed for the continuation of the genocide.A Canadian court has ruled that a former Rwandan official can be deported from Canada for his complicity in crimes against humanity. He had fled Rwanda in 1994 and received refugee status in South Africa before becoming a permanent Canadian resident in 2003. The case establishes an important precedent for the deportation of individuals found to have played a role in atrocities overseas.The Canadian Federal Court upheld the deportation of a former Rwandan politician Leon Mugesera for his role in the 1994 genocide. The court ruled that Mugesera's deportation did not violate his rights or put him at risk of torture despite his fear of being attacked or killed if he returns to Rwanda. Mugesera was convicted in Rwanda in 1999 on charges of inciting murder and genocide through a speech in 1992 in which he called for the extermination and systematic murder of Tutsis.
