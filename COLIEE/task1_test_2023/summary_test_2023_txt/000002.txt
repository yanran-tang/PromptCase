This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada dismissing the applicant's appeal of a rejection of his application for permanent residence under the family class for his three adoptive children. The applicant a Canadian citizen from Cameroon had adopted the children through a process of simple adoption and later filed certificates of full adoption. The IAD held that the adoption was invalid and did not comply with regulations. The application for judicial review raises issues of procedural fairness and assessment of the adoption's legality.The case involves an appeal of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) to deny the adoption of two children from Cameroon by a Canadian citizen. The court must consider whether the IAD breached its duty of procedural fairness by not holding a hearing and whether it correctly interpreted Cameroonian law when denying the adoption. The court notes that the IAD is not required to hold a hearing and that the standard of review for interpreting Cameroonian law is reasonableness. The applicant argues that a hearing would have allowed him to explain apparent contradictions in the interpretation of Cameroonian law. The respondent argues that the applicant had ample opportunity to express his point of view in writing and that the burden was on him to provide evidence to support his position.
