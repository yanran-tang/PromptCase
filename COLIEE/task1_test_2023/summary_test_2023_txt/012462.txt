This is a case of two siblings who claimed refugee protection in Canada due to their fear of persecution in China and Ecuador. They alleged persecution in China due to their association with an underground Christian church and in Ecuador because of their Chinese origin. However the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board determined that their fear had no nexus with a Convention ground and was neither plausible nor credible leading to the dismissal of their application for judicial review.
