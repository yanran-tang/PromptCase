The case concerns an Iranian ophthalmologist's application for permanent residence in Canada as a skilled worker. The visa officer rejected his application awarding him 20 out of 25 points under the Education criterion of the selection grid. The applicant claims that the officer misinterpreted his educational qualifications and the court agrees finding that the officer failed to provide adequate reasons for the decision and violated procedural fairness. The case is sent to another visa officer for reevaluation.
