The case concerns the application for a stay of execution of a removal order for a Jamaican permanent resident who had been convicted of multiple narcotics offenses while living in Canada. The issue revolves around whether executing the removal order while the applicant was still on probation would violate s. 50 of the Immigration Act. The court granted the stay and ordered an interim measure pending a determination of the judicial review application. No costs were awarded on a solicitor and client basis but the applicant was awarded $1500 in costs.
