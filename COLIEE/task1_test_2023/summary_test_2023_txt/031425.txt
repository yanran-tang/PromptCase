This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division to not grant refugee status to an applicant from Angola. The CRDD found the applicant lacked credibility in her account of events and the Federal Court of Canada Trial Division found errors in the CRDD's reasoning. The matter was remitted to another panel of the CRDD for redetermination. The case highlights the importance of giving clear and cogent reasons for decisions in immigration and refugee cases.
