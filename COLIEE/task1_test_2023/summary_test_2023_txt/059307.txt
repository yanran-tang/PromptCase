Michael DiVito after spending ten years in prison in Canada requested a transfer to Canada under the International Transfer of Offenders Act however the Minister of Public Safety denied his request based on the alleged fact that he was a part of an organized crime and his affiliations suggest that his return to Canada would constitute a potential threat to the safety of Canadians and the security of Canada. DiVito challenged the decision but the court ruled that the decision was reasonable and did not violate his mobility rights under the Charter.
