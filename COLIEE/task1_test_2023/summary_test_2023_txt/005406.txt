The plaintiff who identifies himself as an expert in Indian Biblical and political matters submitted a disjointed Statement of Claim seeking various declarations damages and recognition as the uncontradicted Messiah following Her Majesty the Queen. The Crown brought a motion to strike out the Statement of Claim as it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The court dismissed the plaintiff's motion requesting an oral hearing and ultimately struck out the Statement of Claim without leave to amend citing its disjointed and improbable nature.
