The case is about Gordon Teti a black man from Kenya who faced challenges adapting to Canadian culture. He worked as a Citizen Services Officer for the Federal Government but was not renewed after several terms. He brought three grievances which were decided by an Adjudicator under the Public Services Labour Relations Act. The decision is under review. Teti represented himself in the proceedings and mixed assertions of fact and argument in his material.In a case involving grievances of harassment discrimination and unfair disciplinary action the court hears the appeal of a man who claims inadequate legal representation. Limited access to legal aid is noted as a concern. The court ultimately upholds the original decision as evidence not presented at the Adjudicator level cannot be considered. No reviewable error is found in the lack of a transcript of evidence. The court summarizes the three grievances brought by the plaintiff.The Applicant sought relief for lost income damages reinstatement removal of disciplinary action and accountability from managers in a grievance against his ex-employer. The Adjudicator found there was no evidence of bad faith or discrimination to support the non-renewal of his term contract and dismissed two other grievances. The Applicant requests that the Adjudicator's decision be declared null and void and the issue before is whether there is a basis to do so. The standard of review for jurisdictional questions and mixed fact and law questions is reasonableness.
