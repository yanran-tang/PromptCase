This case is a judicial review of a decision by a Pre-Risk Removal Assessment Officer which refused the applicant's request for an exemption from the in-Canada selection criteria for permanent resident status on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The applicant a Tamil citizen of Sri Lanka had been granted refugee status in Canada in 1991 but was later ordered deported in 1996 due to criminal inadmissibility. He re-entered Canada in 2009 and was arrested leading to the deportation order being issued. The Officer refused the H&C application finding that the Applicant had not demonstrated unusual or disproportionate hardship if subject to the Act.The officer reviewing the case found that the applicant had a limited degree of establishment and had shown disregard for Canadian law and was willing to mislead officials. His family ties in Canada were not significant enough for his removal to cause unusual hardship and his ex-wife and children would not suffer disproportionate hardship if he were to be removed to Sri Lanka. The officer ultimately found that denying the H&C application would not be against the best interests of the children.that Sri Lanka had made progress in addressing the human rights concerns that were highlighted in the 2009 Guidelines. The Officer also noted that the Applicant did not demonstrate that he would be targeted for harm upon his return and that the incidents of violence in Sri Lanka have decreased significantly since the end of the civil war. As such the Officer found that the risk to the Applicant upon his return to Sri Lanka did not constitute an unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship and denied the H&C exemption.
