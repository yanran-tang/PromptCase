t Immigration Officer Christine Blackburn on April 1 2009 denying her application for permanent resident status in Canada due to her partner's receipt of ODSP payments which made him ineligible to sponsor her. The Applicant brought an application for judicial review of this decision arguing that the Officer's decision was unreasonable as it failed to consider the Applicant's ability to support herself and her son financially.An immigration officer denied an application for permanent residency due to the applicant's inadmissibility for financial reasons. The applicant's failure to remove herself from her spouse's benefits despite numerous opportunities was cited as proof that she was unable to support herself. The standard of review for this case is reasonableness for questions of fact and mixed law and fact with procedural fairness reviewed under a standard of correctness. Section 11 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act requires that foreign nationals satisfy an immigration officer that they are not inadmissible and that their sponsor complies with the Act.
