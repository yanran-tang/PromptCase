Suleiman Mohammedsae Hussenu an Eritrean citizen and former member of the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) claimed refugee protection in Canada in 2001 based on his fear of persecution in Eritrea due to his political opinion. After an inquiry held under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act a member of the Immigration and Refugee Board determined Hussenu to be inadmissible to Canada under s. 34(1)(f) for being a member of an organization engaged in terrorism. A deportation order was issued and Hussenu applied for judicial review.The applicant was denied admission to Canada based on inadmissibility provisions related to security grounds. He attempted to apply for an exemption on the grounds that his presence in Canada would not be detrimental to the national interest but claims he was told that if found inadmissible deportation would be automatic. The relevant legislation includes sections 33 and 34(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
