Mr. Wing Tse filed a complaint against his former employer Federal Express Canada Ltd. in March 2004 with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The Commission decided not to deal with the complaint as it was based on acts that occurred more than a year before filing. This decision was made under section 41(1)(e) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Mr. Tse also had an earlier complaint dismissed on April 8 2004.The Federal Court of Appeal confirms that the reasons provided by the Canadian Human Rights Commission in its Investigation Report are sufficient. After reviewing the investigator's report it was found that the complainant did not mention losing his job in previous complaints and had filed a complaint of unjust dismissal under the Canada Labour Code. Federal Express claimed that the complaint was trivial frivolous vexatious and made in bad faith.
