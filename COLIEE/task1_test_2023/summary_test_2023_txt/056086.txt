The plaintiff asks for the determination of a limitation fund to satisfy liability and a stay of pending proceedings among other things. The plaintiff admits liability and seeks to prevent claimants from bringing actions in any court. Counsel for some claimants estimates damage at $300000.The Canada Shipping Act allows shipowners to limit liability for damages assuming no fault or privity. Limitation tonnage is defined as the registered tonnage of the vessel and the limit is set at 1000 gold francs per ton.
