The case concerns the validity of a decision made by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada's Refugee Protection Division that denied the principal applicant and her family the status of refugees and persons in need of protection due to threats made by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The court found that the decision was reasonable and based on documentary evidence and therefore dismissed the application for judicial review.
