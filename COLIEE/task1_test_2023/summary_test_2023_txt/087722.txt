Mr. Ranji a citizen of India entered Canada as a visitor in 1997 and had his claim for refugee status refused in 1998. He applied for permanent residency in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in 2005 which was rejected by the same officer who rejected his Pre-Removal Risk Assessment application. Mr. Ranji appealed the decision and the court found that the officer did not properly assess Mr. Ranji's level of establishment in Canada and failed to consider the impact of his return to India on his children's education. The case was referred back for reconsideration by a different officer.
