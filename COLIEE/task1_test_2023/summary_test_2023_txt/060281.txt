The case involves Sonam Dhondup's request to sponsor his de facto dependent children Tenzin Yonten and Tenzin Yeshi for permanent residence in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The Respondent Minister failed to make a decision on the request leading the Applicants to request an order for a writ of mandamus. The application has been allowed and the background reveals the DNA test results had excluded Yonten and Yeshi from the initial sponsorship application prompting their separate application for permanent residence.The PA filed an application for Yonten and Yeshi to be processed under H&C grounds which was agreed upon through a settlement. However the PA received a letter from the CPC suggesting that he was intending to adopt the children which was not his intent. The PA clarified the situation but still faced further obstacles and requirements for adoption. The PA expected their application to be processed under H&C considerations but faced challenges throughout 2005 and 2006.
