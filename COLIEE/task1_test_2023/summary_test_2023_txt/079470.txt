The case involves Fredis Angel Garcia Vasquez a citizen of El Salvador who requested refugee protection in Canada after fleeing from the Mara Salvatrucha (MS 13) gang. Garcia Vasquez had previously worked for the armed forces of El Salvador and later rejoined the army under a one-year contract as part of the government's Antimaras law. Despite receiving special training to capture gang members he was physically assaulted by three gang members while on leave and was later recognized by them in San Salvador. The Immigration and Refugee Board denied his application for refugee status.The Immigration and Refugee Board rejected a claim for asylum by a Salvadoran man seeking protection from the violent gang MS 13. The Board found that although the applicant had been a victim of crime and had refused to join the gang the risks faced by him were generalized and did not establish a nexus to a Convention ground. The Board cited three possible categories of social group and found that the applicant did not qualify under any of them.
