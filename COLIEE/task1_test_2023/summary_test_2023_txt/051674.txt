This is a summary of an application for judicial review of a decision by a visa officer to deny a citizen of Korea permanent residence in Canada's Entrepreneur category. The applicant was a civil engineer who established two construction companies in Taiwan. The visa officer denied the application on the grounds that the applicant did not have the ability to provide active and ongoing participation in an entrepreneurial enterprise in Canada. The relevant statutory provisions impose the burden on the immigrant to prove their right to enter Canada and to comply with the conditions of the Act.The Canadian Immigration Act and its regulations provide conditions and requirements that must be followed by immigrants and visitors. The definition of an entrepreneur includes the ability to establish purchase or invest in a business that will contribute to the Canadian economy and create employment opportunities for Canadians. Visa officers assess immigrants on various factors listed in Schedule 1 but cannot award more units of assessment than the maximum allowed for each factor.The case involves an applicant who claims that the visa officer did not properly assess their qualifications as an Entrepreneur and instead relied on irrelevant considerations. The applicant argues that the visa officer did not fully assess the applicant's experience and did not attempt to verify their concerns. The applicant also claims that the visa officer's finding that the applicant's business was not profitable is inconsistent with information in the applicant's application for permanent residence.
