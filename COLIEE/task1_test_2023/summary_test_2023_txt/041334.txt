The case involves a citizenship judge's decision to deny citizenship to the applicant due to not fulfilling the requirements of the Citizenship Act. The judge needs to evaluate the factors listed in Re Koo 1993 1 F.C. 286 and determine if the applicant regularly normally or customarily lives in Canada. The appeal is allowed and the case is returned to another citizenship judge for further assessment.The case concerns a citizenship application from a Congolese refugee who had become a permanent resident in Canada in 2000. His application was rejected by a Citizenship Judge which was then appealed. The court had to consider whether new evidence was admissible whether the judge assessed the evidence unreasonably and whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias. The applicant argued that the judge did not give proper consideration to his affidavit as no passports were demanded from him. He also claimed the judge had a duty to inform him of the contents of a computer note that would have denied him citizenship before he had the chance to hand in a questionnaire. The respondent argued that the applicant could not submit new evidence and that the judge advised him of his doubts in a reasonable manner and there was no breach of natural justice.
