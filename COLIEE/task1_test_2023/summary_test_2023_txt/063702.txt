The case involves Hungarian citizens who claimed refugee status in Canada due to mistreatment they suffered in their home country because of their ethnicity. The Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed their claims questioning the evidence presented and whether state authorities in Hungary could not protect them. The applicants challenged the decision and asked for a new hearing but the court found no basis to overturn the Board's decision as it was reasonable in light of the evidence. The court dismissed the application for judicial review.
