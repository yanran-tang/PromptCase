The case concerns a group of approximately 25 applicants seeking relief to stop their deportation and to allow them permanent residence in Canada. The applicants intended to claim refugee status in Canada before January 1 1989 and were included in the Backlog Clearance Programme. The relief sought includes an order to quash a decision by immigration officials and to compel the respondent to provide a full and fair interview of the applicant's humanitarian and compassionate claim. Additionally the applicants request a review of the decision to refuse them the benefits of the policy known as Current Processing Procedures for Persons from the Peoples' Republic of China.The applicant a Chinese national with a registered refugee claim was denied the benefits of a Canadian policy guideline that protects Chinese visitors and students from being sent back to the conflict-ridden People's Republic of China due to individual embarrassment. The policy was not meant for registered claimants like the applicant and the decision was not unfair or a breach of the general duty of fairness. Mandamus was also not available to force a change in the policy's terms for the applicant's circumstances.The court ruled that there is no duty on the Minister to apply the OM IS 399 policy so a writ of mandamus cannot be used to force the Minister to do so. The applicants argued that the Minister failed to fulfill the legitimate expectation of a humanitarian and compassionate review promised to individuals in the Refugee Backlog. The court stated that the discretion conferred by section 114(2) of the Act should not be fettered but rather applied evenly to all who come before it. The court did not address the argument that the exercise of discretion for refugee claimants versus other aliens in Canada violates section 15 of the Charter.
