The Chief Pensions Advocate seeks judicial review of an interpretation decision made by the Veterans Review Appeal Board in 2005 which concluded that new evidence submitted to the Board upon an application for reconsideration of an appeal decision would generally be subject to the requirements of due diligence. The applicant seeks an order to quash or set aside the decision. The Board concluded that a person seeking reconsideration of a decision based on new evidence must generally demonstrate that there had been no lack of due diligence in obtaining that evidence.The Veterans Review and Appeal Board concluded that new evidence presented for reconsideration must meet the standard of due diligence and that administrative efficiency is a secondary consideration. The applicant argues that this decision is reviewable on the standard of correctness and that the Board improperly supplemented the text of the statute. The respondent argues that the appropriate standard of review is patent unreasonableness and that the Board correctly interpreted the relevant sections of the VRAB Act.
