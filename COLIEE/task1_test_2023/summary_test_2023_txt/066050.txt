The case involves a request for certification of a question regarding the absence of procedural rights in a criminal trial where the death penalty may be imposed and whether it constitutes persecution within the definition of a Convention refugee. The judge declined to certify the question since it did not meet the requirement of being a serious question of general importance and the answer to the proposed question would not determine the appeal. There was also no evidence presented to counter the presumption of validity or neutrality of Chinese criminal procedure.
