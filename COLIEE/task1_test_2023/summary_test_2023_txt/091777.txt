The applicant's request for a stay of the immigration inquiry was dismissed by Justice Strayer on the basis that there was no serious issue raised regarding the adjudicator's order for the applicant to testify. The hearing was to determine whether the applicant was inadmissible due to a conviction outside of Canada and the Charter argument presented by the applicant's counsel was rejected. The applicant may still seek further stay if granted leave for judicial review but there is no right of appeal in this circumstance.
