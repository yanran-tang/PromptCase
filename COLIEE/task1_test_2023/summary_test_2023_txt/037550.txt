This case concerns the costs incurred by the applicant Mr. Abdelrazik in his successful application to return to Canada after being stranded in Sudan for six years. He is seeking $127600 in solicitor-client costs set as a lump sum. The court was not required to issue further decisions as the Canadian government arranged for Mr. Abdelrazik's return to Canada. The applicant's legal team consisted of five lawyers and he was successful in his application with allegations of bad faith and constitutional rights violations by the respondents.A Canadian court has ordered the federal government to pay CAD 21.8m to Ibrahim Abdelrazik who has been on a UN flight ban since 2006 after he alleged that officials played a part in his detention and alleged torture in Sudan. The government initially fought the case but decided to settle in 2019 as part of a broader government reform package saying it would create a suitable process that upholds the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
