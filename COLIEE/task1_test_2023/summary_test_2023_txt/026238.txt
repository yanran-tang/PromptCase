This is a case of judicial review of a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision that denied an application to amend two pay equity complaints. The complaints had been amended previously but were not referred to the Tribunal in their amended form. The Commission seeks judicial review arguing that the Tribunal made an error of law or jurisdiction by not amending the complaints. The case involves allegations of sex discrimination in wages paid to employees in predominantly female groups in comparison to predominantly male classes. The parties involved are the Commission the Tribunal the Canadian Telephone Employees Association the Communications Energy and Paper Workers Union of Canada Femmes Action and Bell Canada. Attempts to settle the wage disparity were made but failed leading to additional systemic complaints filed in 1994.Amendments were made to three complaints regarding pay equity at Bell Canada to reflect the findings of a joint study. The Canadian Human Rights Commission produced investigation reports recommending that two of the complaints be referred to a tribunal. These complaints were eventually referred in May 1996. The Commission later attempted to replace the original complaints with the amended versions but their motion was dismissed by the tribunal in August 2000.
