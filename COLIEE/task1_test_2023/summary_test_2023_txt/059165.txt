The applicant appealed the decision of Prothonotary Richard Morneau who had dismissed her application for an extension of time to file and serve her record. The applicant did not meet the deadline to perfect her leave application which led to the respondent requesting for the leave application to be disposed of. The Prothonotary dismissed the applicant's motion for an extension of time which was based on the applicant's lack of awareness of the periods prescribed by the Rules. The applicant based her appeal on two grounds challenging the Prothonotary's exercise of power and jurisdiction. However both grounds were dismissed and it was noted that a prothonotary's jurisdiction to hear interlocutory applications comes directly from the Federal Court Act itself.
