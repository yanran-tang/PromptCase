Minolta-QMS now Konica Minolta Printing Solutions succeeded in their appeal against the registration of the MAGICOLOR trademark filed by Cheng-Lang Tsai. The Registrar of Trademarks had initially rejected Minolta-QMSâ€™s opposition to the registration due to the likelihood of confusion between the two marks. The court concluded that as of the date of filing of the statement of opposition the MAGICOLOR trademark was not distinctive and that Mr. Tsai was not entitled to register it.
