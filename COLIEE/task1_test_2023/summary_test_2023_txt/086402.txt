The case involves Lawrence Agecoutay the Inherent Head-Chief of the Anishinabe Nations seeking mandamus against the Crown to pay annuities and augmented annuities to the Anishinabe Nations. The Applicant representing himself faced delay and difficulty with procedure resulting in a motion to strike out the proceeding by the Crown which was denied in December 2003. However the Applicant's apparent lack of interest and ongoing delay led to a dismissal for delay on an interim status review with costs awarded to the Crown.
