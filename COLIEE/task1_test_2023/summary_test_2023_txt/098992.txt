Three applications for judicial review were filed against the Minister of National Revenue’s decision to deny requests for cancellations of interest and penalties on three late tax returns. Issues raised include whether the Minister’s decisions were reasonable whether third-party actions can justify late filing and whether the respondent can amend its name. In one case the liquidator of an estate filed late returns due to difficulty in obtaining necessary documents.The Applicant filed his income tax returns late for the 2003 and 2004 taxation years and was assessed with penalties and interest. After being diagnosed with cancer the Applicant requested cancellation of accrued interest and penalties but was only partially granted relief by the Minister. The Respondent refused to grant relief for the penalty as the returns were still late.The Canadian Minister of National Revenue reduced interest and cancelled a repeated failure penalty for the 2003 taxation year for Charlotte Jones whose late husband's medical condition prevented her from filing taxes on time. However the minister rejected the late filing penalty relief. For the 2004 taxation year the minister reduced the arrears interest but did not adjust for the repeated late-filing penalty. The relevant legislative provisions can be found in Appendix A.The case involves the deceased taxpayer Charlotte Jones and the Applicant who is the liquidator and sole beneficiary of the estate. The Applicant had difficulty filing tax returns for Charlotte and her husband Ronald Jones due to the complexity of their estates including shares and a business partnership. The Applicant also faced personal challenges including a cancer diagnosis. The Respondent argues that the Minister's decision to deny relief was reasonable while the Applicant argues that his brother handled the business partnership and he wanted to honor his brother's memory by paying all debt.
