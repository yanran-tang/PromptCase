The plaintiff in a settled civil action seeks an order requiring the return or destruction of documents copied during discovery which were not admitted into evidence or part of the public record. The Crown's lawyers had requested the plaintiff's instructions regarding the documents and later argued that they could not be returned or destroyed due to obligations under the National Archives of Canada Act. The court however ruled that the documents were subject to the implied undertaking and must be returned to the plaintiff. The court also awarded the plaintiff the costs of the motion on a solicitor and client basis due to the conduct of the Crown's lawyers.
