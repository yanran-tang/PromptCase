Defendants have brought a motion for summary judgment to dismiss the plaintiff's trademark infringement case on the grounds that the oval-shaped cable tie is not subject to trademark rights and the plaintiff has not used the term BARB TIE in Canada. The plaintiff is seeking a declaration of infringement passing off and damages for their trademarked cable ties used in various industries as a commodity.The dispute is about the trademark of oval-shaped cable tie heads. Cable ties are used for bundling wires and cables and the tongue in the head prevents it from being pulled in the opposite direction. The major competitors in the Canadian market are Thomas & Betts with TY FAST and TY RAP and Panduit with PAN-TY and BARB-TY. The Thomas & Betts Patent from 1967 expired in 1984 and it describes a simple oval-shaped head as the preferred embodiment for self-clinching bundling straps.A patent specification must provide a full and accurate description of the invention including its operation and use as intended by the inventor in order to enable someone skilled in the relevant field to replicate the invention. The specification must also include drawings and a distinct statement of the claimed invention. The purpose behind these requirements is to ensure that the public can use the invention once the patent expires. Failure to provide a complete and accurate specification can result in invalidation of the patent.
