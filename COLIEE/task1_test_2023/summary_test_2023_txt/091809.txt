Mr. King a veteran contended that he is entitled to a pension due to contracting hepatitis and tuberculosis while on duty in Sardinia in 1968. He was unsuccessful in his previous applications leading to a judicial review of the last decision. The court found the decision to be patently unreasonable and the legislation is intended to facilitate the awarding of a pension wherever reasonably possible. The Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act also supports this conclusion.The Pension Act requires the Board to interpret claims by veterans liberally and to draw every reasonable inference in favor of the applicant. Section 21(3) also creates favorable presumptions for injuries or diseases incurred during military service. Brigadier General served in the Canadian Armed Forces from 1959 to 1991 and contracted Hepatitis and later Genitourinary Tuberculosis which he claims is a consequence of his Hepatitis infection. The initial claim was denied but the applicant appeals for a pension under the Pension Act.
