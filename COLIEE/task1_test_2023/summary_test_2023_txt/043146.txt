The Federal Court upheld a Citizenship Judge's decision to deny an applicant citizenship because they did not meet the required minimum of 1095 days of residency in Canada finding the decision reasonable based on the applicant's regular and substantial absences though it acknowledged an error in the description of one absence. The applicant had arrived in Canada as a landed immigrant and purchased a home but also operated a business exporting Canadian products to China.
