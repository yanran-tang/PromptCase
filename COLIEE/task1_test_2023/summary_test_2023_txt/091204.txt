The case involves a claim for damages to cargo resulting from a collision between the vessels Beograd and Federal Danube. The plaintiff an insurer from Brazil is seeking to recover the indemnity paid to the cargo owner and the costs incurred in the salvage of the damaged cargo from the defendants who are owners or parties interested in the Federal Danube. The court must resolve various issues including ownership of the damaged cargo whether the plaintiff is authorized to sue in their name and the responsibility of Federal Danube for the collision.On December 11 1984 the Federal Danube collided with the Beograd near Pointe Fortier in the Lac St-Louis region of Montreal. The Federal Danube was heaving its anchor at the time causing it to veer uncontrollably and collide with the Beograd. The parties disagree on who was at fault: the plaintiff blames the Federal Danube for failing to follow regulations and maintain a lookout while the defendants argue that the Beograd was at fault for navigating outside the established channel and not anticipating the current. The collision caused severe damage to the cargo of the Beograd leading to a salvage contract with McAllister Towing and Salvage Inc.n order to prove the existence of an insurance contract between the plaintiff and the cargo owner. The contract covered damage to the cargo during transportation by sea. The cargo sustained damage during the voyage and was eventually sold on the salvage market in Montreal resulting in a substantial loss for the cargo owner. The plaintiff seeks recovery of indemnification paid to the cargo owner and other related expenses. Admissions were made by the parties including exchange rates and sales prices of the salvaged cargo. The court was assisted by two assessors. The shipping vessel's liability limit was also discussed.
