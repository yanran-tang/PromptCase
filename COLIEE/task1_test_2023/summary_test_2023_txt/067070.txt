The case involved Mohammed Abul Mahatab a citizen of Bangladesh who applied for permanent residence in Canada in 1997 but his application was later refused by visa officer Gregory Chubak. Mahatab challenged the decision through judicial review. The court ruled that the visa officer did a full and complete assessment of Mahatab's intended occupations and found no errors that would warrant judicial intervention.
