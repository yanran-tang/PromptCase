This case concerns an application for judicial review of a negative decision of a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Officer (the Officer) concerning Indrakumar Mahendran (the Applicant) who is a Tamil citizen of Sri Lanka. The Applicant fled Sri Lanka in 2001 and arrived in Canada in 2004 seeking asylum which was denied in 2006. His application for a pre-removal risk assessment was also refused in 2009. The Applicant argued that the Officer erred in law by requiring him to establish a personalized risk and by failing to conduct a proper assessment of his claim. The Court found a breach of the duty of fairness and remitted the matter back for redetermination by a newly appointed Officer.
