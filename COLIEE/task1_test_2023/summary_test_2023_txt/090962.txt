A judge clarified points in a previous judgment including correcting two errors and ruled on matters the parties could not agree on. The judge found validity and infringement of a patent and directed the delivery up of wheelchairs and parts that offend the claims in question. The judge did not allow an amendment to include a claim for prejudgment interest and ruled that an expert witness was entitled to be paid. The formal judgment will reflect the ruling.
