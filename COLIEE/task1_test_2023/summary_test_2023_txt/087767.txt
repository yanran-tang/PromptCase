Harjeet Singh Khaira applied for refugee status in Canada as he feared being tortured by police if he returns to India due to his association with a wanted individual. However a panel of the Refugee Protection Division refused to recognize him as a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Khaira filed an application for judicial review and the Court deemed the panel's reasons for denial insufficient and referred the matter to another panel for redetermination.
