John E. Canning Ltd. in action T-477-98 brought a rule 369 motion in writing for an order pursuant to rule 105 of the Federal Court Rules 1998 that action T-477-98 be consolidated or heard at the same time as action T-110-98 or alternatively that action T-110-98 be stayed pending the determination of action T-477-98 or pending an action commenced by Tripap Inc. as plaintiff in the Quebec Superior Court where Canning is the defendant. The court dismissed the motion in its entirety stating that none of the pre-conditions for a consolidation order existed in the two actions.
