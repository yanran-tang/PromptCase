In 2004 the Immigration and Refugee Board's decision to grant a stay of deportation to Martin Richard Hyde was referred back to the board to decide if he breached the terms of the stay. The board ruled in 2005 that Hyde had indeed breached the stay leading to a dispute over the board's jurisdiction to review the stay under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration argued the board had no jurisdiction while Hyde disagreed.In 1999 Mr. Hyde was found to be a person described in subsections 27(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the previous Canadian Immigration Act leading to a deportation order. However the Immigration Appeal Division granted Mr. Hyde a five-year stay subject to certain conditions. In 2002 Mr. Hyde pleaded guilty to two drug-related charges and his stay was reviewed in 2003. The Minister argued that Mr. Hyde breached the conditions of his stay and is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality and lacks the right to appeal to the IAD. The tribunal rejected the Minister's argument.The case involves an individual who was determined to be inadmissible on the basis of sub paragraphs 27(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act for offences for which he was sentenced to four years of imprisonment. The panel determined that the individual would also be inadmissible under IRPA on the basis of serious criminality since he was convicted of an offence and a term of imprisonment of more than six months. However the panel could not follow the Minister's counsel's reasoning since she omitted important sections such as section 68(4) of the IRPA which refers to subsection 36(1) to determine if the stay should be cancelled by operation of law. The panel concluded that the individual's offences did not correspond to subsection 36(1) as they were not punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least ten years.
