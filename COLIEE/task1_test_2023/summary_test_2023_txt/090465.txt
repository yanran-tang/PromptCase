The case concerns an appeal by the Canadian Minister of Citizenship against a citizenship judge's decision to grant citizenship to Mr. Salim. The Minister argued that the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision and that Mr. Salim did not satisfy the residency requirements of the Act. The judge had approved Mr. Salim's application despite evidence that he had spent less than the required amount of time in Canada over the preceding four years. The court found that the reasons given by the judge were inadequate and referred the matter back to be redetermined.
