The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration appealed the decision of a Citizenship Judge claiming that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Dina El-Koussa met the residency requirements under subsection 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act. The Citizenship Judge's decision lacked adequate reasons making it difficult to assess the reasonableness of the decision. As a result the appeal was granted and the matter was referred back to a different citizenship judge for re-determination.
