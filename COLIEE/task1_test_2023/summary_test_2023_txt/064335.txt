The case involves an applicant who fled to Canada from Mexico after allegedly being raped and harassed by a man named Ernesto Salazar Romero. The applicant applied for refugee protection but was denied by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Federal Court later upheld the denial finding that the applicant's testimony was inconsistent and lacked credibility. The court also rejected the argument that the applicant's fear of state protection and internal flight alternatives were unreasonable. The application for judicial review was dismissed.
