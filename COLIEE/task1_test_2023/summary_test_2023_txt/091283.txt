An application for judicial review was allowed against the decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to decline dealing with an applicant's complaint against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) pursuant to the Canadian Human Rights Act. The applicant had filed a formal harassment complaint against her senior officer which was substantiated but no disciplinary action was taken before he retired and the RCMP declined to take further action. The applicant filed a complaint with the Commission alleging discrimination and harassment.The case concerns a complaint of discrimination against the RCMP. The Canadian Human Rights Commission declined to deal with the complaint on the basis that it was filed more than a year after the alleged incidents occurred. The applicant seeks judicial review of this decision arguing that it was a breach of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The issue to be considered is whether the Commission made a reviewable error in dismissing the complaint.
