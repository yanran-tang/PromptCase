The case involves Mr. Usta a Turkish citizen and member of Hizmet who claimed refugee status in Canada based on conscientious objection to military service and fear of persecution due to his religion and political opinions. The Immigration and Refugee Board rejected his claim and this application for judicial review followed. The Court found no errors in the Board's decision and dismissed the application. The Board had determined among other things that the Turkish law requiring military service and its consequences were not persecutory and Mr. Usta lacked credibility in his testimony.
