This is a judicial review of the negative decision of the Refugee Protection Division for the applicant to be deemed a Convention refugee or person in need of protection. The applicant a Chinese citizen claimed persecution due to her Christian beliefs and an underground church. The Board found the applicant lacked credibility and there was no serious possibility of persecution should she return to China.The Canadian government's Immigration and Refugee Board deemed Fujian province to have the most liberal policy on religion in China particularly regarding Christianity. Though some Christians were arrested in China between 2005 and 2008 none were noted to have occurred in Fujian. The Board concluded that the applicant could safely practice unregistered Christianity in an unraided house church in Fujian despite widespread persecution in other provinces. The assessment was made under the asylum-seeker criteria for refugees and persons in need of protection.
