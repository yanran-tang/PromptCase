Dr. Jamal Murad sought a writ of mandamus after not receiving a decision on his citizenship application. The application should have been decided within 60 days with a maximum extension of six months. A recommendation was made in March 2011 but not transmitted to the applicant and as of May 2012 he had still not received a decision. In July 2012 an agent reviewed his file and recommended a report of inadmissibility which led to a notice to appear for removal from Canada. The court ordered the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to grant citizenship to the applicant.Dr. Jamal Murad applied for Canadian citizenship in 2008; however he struggled to find employment as a medical doctor in the country and often returned to Jordan for extended periods. While he passed his citizenship test in 2009 the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) official overseeing his file became concerned with his prolonged absences from Canada and requested further documentation in March of that year.A Syrian doctor named Dina Murad who applied for Canadian citizenship faced a long and complex process raising several questions about his case. Despite presenting documentation and going through a hearing with a citizenship judge who recommended approval Murad heard nothing for over a year until he was finally approved. Internal correspondence at Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) showed that some considered appealing the decision but the 60-day time limit for an appeal had expired.
