The case involves a Colombian family whose claim to refugee protection was denied by the Immigration Refugee Board. The Board rejected their claims on the basis that they had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection. However the Federal Court found that the Board's state protection finding was insufficient and a basis for setting the decision aside as it failed to address the evidence of personal risk in a meaningful way or at all. The matter was ordered to be redetermined on the merits by a different decision-maker.
