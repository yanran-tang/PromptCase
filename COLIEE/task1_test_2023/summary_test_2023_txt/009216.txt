Narinder Kaur Anttal a Canadian citizen applied twice to sponsor her husband a citizen and resident of India for immigration to Canada. The Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) dismissed her second application on the basis of res judicata despite new evidence put forward by Anttal. In a judicial review application she sought to overturn the decision of the IAD. However the court dismissed her application on the grounds that the IAD's decision was not patently unreasonable and that its refusal to adjourn the hearing was not a violation of procedural fairness.
