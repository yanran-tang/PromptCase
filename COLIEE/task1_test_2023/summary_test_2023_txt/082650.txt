The defendants are seeking to strike out certain questions from a written examination for discovery in a case involving a collision at Sydney Harbour Nova Scotia. The plaintiff served a written examination due to logistical difficulties with oral discovery. The defendants objected to certain questions leading to this application to the court. The standard for propriety of a question asked in discovery is less strict than the test for admissibility of evidence at trial and the information solicited by a question must be potentially relevant to matters in issue on the basis of pleadings filed by the parties.The case involves objections brought forward by the defendants during the discovery phase of a lawsuit specifically related to questions about prior incidents involving ships commanded by the defendant which the plaintiff argues may be relevant to facts in issue. The court concludes that the party asking the question must demonstrate that the information they seek may be relevant to a fact in issue and that the benefits of openness in pretrial proceedings favours requiring the answer to be given. It is ultimately up to the trial judge to determine the ultimate relevance and weight of the evidence.
