This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board determining that German Guillermo Molano Fonnol and his family are excluded from Convention refugee status under section 1E of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Mr. Fonnol claims refugee protection from persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia for his perceived political opinions and membership in the Liberal party. The application for judicial review is dismissed in part.The case involves Mr. Fonnoll and Ms. Miranda Colombian nationals who fled Colombia due to their involvement with the Liberal party and the threat of violence. They entered the United States as visitors and applied for asylum which was rejected but they were granted a withholding of removal. In 2008 they left for Canada fearing possible deportation from the US. The main issues were whether they were excluded from Convention refugee status under Article 1E and whether they were Convention refugees or persons in need of protection which were reviewed under the standards of correctness and reasonableness respectively.
