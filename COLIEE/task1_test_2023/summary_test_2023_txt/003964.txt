The case involves an Indian citizen Mr. Singh who applied for permanent residency in Canada as an assisted relative. A visa officer denied his application citing his lack of reasonable language skills failure to seek substantial employment opportunities and lack of motivation. However the Federal Court of Canada found that the officer had applied irrelevant considerations and set aside the decision ordering a redetermination by a different visa officer.
