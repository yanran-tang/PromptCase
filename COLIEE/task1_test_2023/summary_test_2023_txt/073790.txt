The Canadian Federal Court dismissed an application for judicial review by a Guatemalan citizen Mr. Casimiro Santos who argued that he was wrongly found to be inadmissible to Canada due to a conviction in the United States for having failed to remain at the scene of an accident. Mr. Casimiro argued that the law he was convicted under in the United States was not equivalent to the equivalent Canadian law causing his inadmissibility. The Court disagreed stating that the law was equivalent based on the evidence presented. The Court ultimately found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Casimiro was inadmissible to Canada based on criminality grounds and his application was accordingly dismissed.
