Imran Zaib's application for a permanent resident visa was refused due to concerns about the legitimacy of his Bachelor's degree. The visa officer received a confirmation letter from the University of the Punjab that was subsequently found to be a fake. However the officer did not accurately describe the extrinsic evidence obtained resulting in Mr. Zaib being denied a fair opportunity to provide a meaningful response. The case was allowed for judicial review and remitted to a different visa officer for re-determination with careful scrutiny of Mr. Zaib's educational qualifications.
