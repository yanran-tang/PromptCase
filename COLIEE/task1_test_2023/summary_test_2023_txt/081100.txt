Alagaratnam Nagulathas was found to be inadmissible to Canada after it was determined that he was a member of a terrorist organization. He applied for a mandamus which was rendered moot after a decision was made on his immigration application. He sought costs for the mandamus application but the court was not persuaded that there were special reasons justifying an award of costs. The court also noted that Nagulathas had lied on his initial immigration application which contributed to delays in processing the application. Therefore his motion for costs was dismissed.
