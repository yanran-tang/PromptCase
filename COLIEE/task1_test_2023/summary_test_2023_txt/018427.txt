The Minister of Human Resources Development Canada applied for judicial review of a decision by the Old Age Security Review Tribunal that the Minister should use the statutory power given to her in favour of Miss Mitchell after she was denied a Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) benefit due to erroneous advice. The court found that the Review Tribunal had no jurisdiction and the proper remedy for Miss Mitchell was to apply directly to the court for judicial review of the Minister's decision. The court did award Miss Mitchell her out-of-pocket disbursements for the proceeding.
