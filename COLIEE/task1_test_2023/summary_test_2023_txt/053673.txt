The trademark infringement case involves SUNSOLAR ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES (S.E.T.) INC. as the plaintiff and a group of defendants including Daniel O'Brien who was seeking to be struck as a party. The court determined that the allegations against O'Brien lacked specific factual evidence to conclude that he was directly involved in the infringement and he was subsequently struck from the case. The court ordered the defendants to file an amended statement of defence and counterclaim.
