The application for judicial review focuses solely on whether deportation to Croatia would violate section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The judge dismissed the application stating that it would be premature to decide if deportation to Croatia is cruel and unusual until the removal is attempted. The applicant's request for certification to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed.
