The case concerns the reassessment of income tax payable by Mr. Connell for the 1979 and 1980 taxation years. The Tax Court of Canada allowed his appeal from those reassessments but gave no reasons for its conclusions. The issue in question was whether farming was Mr. Connell's main source of income or not as it affected the tax deductions he claimed. The court ultimately found that he had not proven that farming was his chief source of income and confirmed the Minister of National Revenue's reassessments.
