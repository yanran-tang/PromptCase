Tania Elisa Segura Cortes a citizen of Mexico sought asylum in Canada based on her fear of Luis Antonio Castillo Flores her former boyfriend who had abused her and threatened her life. However the Immigration and Refugee Board denied her refugee claim stating that she had not established lack of state protection in Mexico. The applicant tried setting aside this decision by arguing that the Board failed to determine whether she fell under the exception for persons who failed to report their persecution to local authorities but the court found that her arguments lacked an adequate evidentiary foundation. Consequently the court dismissed her application.
