This case is an application for judicial review of a Registrar of Trademarks decision to give public notice of the adoption and use of the MILLENNIUM official mark by Liquor Control Board of Ontario which conflicts with the applicant's trademark registration. The main issues are whether the respondent had adopted and used the official mark prior to November 12 1998 and whether subparagraph 9(1)(n)(iii) of the Trade-marks Act is ultra vires the Parliament of Canada or contrary to section 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.The question of whether a trademark is confusing should be given great weight but a judge hearing an appeal from the Registrar's decision still has the responsibility to determine the issue based on the circumstances of the case. The standard of review is usually reasonableness simpliciter but if new evidence is presented that would have materially affected the Registrar's decision the standard of review shifts to correctness. In the present case new evidence has been presented that would have affected the Registrar's decision and the judge must come to their own conclusion about the correctness of the decision.
