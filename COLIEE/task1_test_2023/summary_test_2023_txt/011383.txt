The Federal Court considered an application by Rasalingam Arulraj seeking to set aside the decision of a Visa Officer rejecting his request to remain in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Arulraj conceded that he could not bring himself within the spousal class due to his wife's failure to disclose their marital circumstances during her application for permanent residency. Arulraj argued that the Visa Officer erred in refusing to grant him landed status on H & C grounds specifically in failing to properly consider the best interests of his two children. The court found that the Visa Officer's decision was unreasonable and necessitated a re-consideration of Arulraj's claim by a different visa officer.
