The case involves an appeal of Citizenship Judge William Day's decision to refuse the applicant's request for Canadian citizenship citing failure to sufficiently centralize his life in Canada according to paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act. The applicant first arrived in Canada in 1993 and applied for citizenship in 1999 but his extended absences from Canada -- including nine semesters spent studying in California -- led the judge to conclude that he had not spent enough time in Canada to fulfill the intent of the Act.The applicant's application for Canadian citizenship was refused due to not meeting the requirement of centralized existence in Canada. Their time spent in the USA for education with their girlfriend was recognized as a concern. The judge noted the importance of becoming part of Canadian society and considered making a recommendation for the application. The applicant did not file any supporting material under subsections 5(3) and (4) of the Act.
