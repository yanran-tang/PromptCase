Richard Loyer's complaint against Air Canada regarding alleged discrimination due to a misdiagnosis of alcoholism was dismissed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission as they believed the issue had been addressed through arbitration. Loyer sought judicial review but the application was dismissed as the Commission had not erred. Loyer also pursued other legal actions against Air Canada and their medical specialists.Air Canada sought protection from its creditors under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act which allowed for a temporary stay on legal proceedings against the airline. In the process of emerging from creditor protection with a “clean slate” Air Canada established an expedited arbitration process to handle outstanding grievances including those of employee Captain Michel Loyer. Mr. Loyer’s grievance arbitration resulted in a settlement that was deemed to be effective on the date his disability benefits expired but controversy arose over whether he verbally agreed to the terms of the settlement.Loyer's human rights complaint was challenged in a judicial review after it was found that the settlement of the complaint had not been referred to the Canadian Human Rights Commission for approval in accordance with section 48 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Investigator's Report focused primarily on the events of June 10 and August 24 2004. The recommendation to dismiss the complaint was accepted by the Commissioners of the Canadian Human Rights Commission.
