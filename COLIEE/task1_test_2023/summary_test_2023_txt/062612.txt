Canadian citizen Gentian Balili serving a sentence in the United States for drug conspiracy applied to the Canadian Minister for transfer to a Canadian prison. Despite a favourable recommendation the application was refused by the Minister who cited Balili’s association with Eastern European organized crime subjects from Detroit as grounds for his decision. In a judicial review Justice Hughes found that Balili had not been given a fair opportunity to respond to that information and that the Minister’s reasons were inadequate and ordered the review be allowed with costs fixed at CAD 5000.
