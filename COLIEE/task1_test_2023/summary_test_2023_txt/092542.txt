This is an application for judicial review of the decision of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness denying the applicant's request to be transferred to Canada from the US to serve his sentence for conspiracy to import marijuana. The denial was based on the belief that the applicant would commit terrorism or organized crime upon his return to Canada. The applicant is seeking a declaration of his constitutional right to enter Canada and a quashing of the decision.The case involves an application for transfer of a Canadian citizen incarcerated in the US to Canada. The applicant submitted letters of support and supplementary material for consideration. The transfer was approved by the US but the Canadian Minister of Public Safety denied it based on concerns of drug trafficking and links to organized crime. The case raises three issues including the constitutionality of provisions giving the Minister jurisdiction to deny entry and whether the Minister's decision was unreasonable. The applicant argues that Canadian citizens have a special status conferred by the Constitution and cannot have citizenship revoked based on conduct.
