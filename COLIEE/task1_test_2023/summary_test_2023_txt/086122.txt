The Lake Petitcodiac Preservation Association Inc. sought interim relief in June 1998 to prevent the trial project (the Petitcodiac River Trial Gate Opening Project) from going ahead. The project aimed to partially restore the natural ecosystem of the Petitcodiac River by allowing tidal water to flow upstream past the causeway. The association's concern was with the decision and action to proceed with the trial project which could alter the water level of Lake Petitcodiac affect its ecosystem and impact recreational opportunities for local residents. Ultimately the court dismissed the association's application for interim relief.An applicant applied for an environmental assessment to be carried out under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act before a trial project was initiated. After a hearing the respondent federal ministers agreed to undertake an environmental assessment which was completed on May 19 1998 concluding that the project with appropriate mitigation measures was not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. The applicant's motion for interim relief was dismissed without prejudice allowing them to file a new application for judicial review based on the screening report.
