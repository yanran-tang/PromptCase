The plaintiff Harbans Singh Pawar seeks to certify a class action and appoint himself as the representative plaintiff for Canadian citizens or permanent residents of 65 years or older who have not resided in Canada for the required 10 consecutive years leading up to pensionability. Mr. Pawar seeks a declaration that a section of the Old Age Security Act is invalid and liability for damages under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The court considers whether the plaintiff's action for damages is futile and whether certification should be granted. The action for a declaration is certified and Mr. Pawar is appointed as the representative plaintiff for the class.
