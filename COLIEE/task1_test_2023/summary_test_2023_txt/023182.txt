The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) that the applicant a Sikh from India is not a refugee under the Convention. The applicant claimed a well-founded fear of persecution having been arrested twice tortured and beaten by the police in the past. The CRDD accepted his identity but found aspects of his story implausible and concluded that there would be no more than a mere possibility of persecution if he returned to India. The court ruled that the appropriate standard of review for such determinations remains patent unreasonableness but may be subject to intervention if there is a palpable error or if the Board’s conclusion is not supported by a reasonable interpretation of the facts. The court found that the Board’s decision was patently unreasonable as it had failed to consider evidence indicating that the police list represented a threat and the applicant had been arrested twice before during the same period. The application was granted and the matter was returned for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.
