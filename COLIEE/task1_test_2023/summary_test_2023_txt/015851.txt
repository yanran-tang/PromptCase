Mr. Hensley Oriji seeks review of a Public Service Commission (PSC) decision that dismissed his complaint of improper revocation of an employment offer by Public Works and Government Services Canada. The applicant asks for the decision to be set aside a mandatory order for merit-based principles and an order of mandamus. The applicant's claim also relates to an open competition for a Systems and Accounting Clerk position.The case involves a complaint launched by the applicant Mr. Oriji after Public Works rescinded an offer of a CR-04 position he had applied for. The investigation concluded that there was no proper offer of employment made to Mr. Oriji but Public Works later offered him a 6-month term contract if he passed the language tests and dropped his complaint. Mr. Oriji did not attend the language testing and later dropped out of consideration for the position.The applicant's complaint against Public Works was remitted for reconsideration by a different PSC investigator who found the complaint unfounded. The investigator concluded that the applicant was never given an offer of employment there was no eligibility list for the CR-04 position and the employee who received the position was appointed in accordance with the merit principle. The applicant had previously challenged the investigator's decision on judicial review which resulted in the complaint being reconsidered.
