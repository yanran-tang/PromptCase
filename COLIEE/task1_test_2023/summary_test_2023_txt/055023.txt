The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration appealed a decision by the Citizenship judge to approve granting Canadian citizenship to Ms. Fai Sophia Lam. The Minister argued that the judge erred in finding that Lam met the residency requirements. The court concluded that Lam's application for citizenship was premature and that she did not establish herself as a resident until her return from Hong Kong in 1995 making the Papadogiorgakis case irrelevant. The Minister's appeal was allowed.
