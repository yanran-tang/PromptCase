The applicant in question was not given a proper opportunity to present his evidence of past persecution and whether there was a well-founded fear of future persecution. The Board continually prevented the applicant from presenting evidence relevant to persecution prior to 1990 and ignored evidence relating to the implausibility of two matters related by the applicant. The application is granted with the decision of the board being set aside and the matter referred back for redetermination.
