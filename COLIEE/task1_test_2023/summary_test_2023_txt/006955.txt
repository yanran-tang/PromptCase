The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The applicant claims to have suffered persecution due to his political opinion after pushing a police officer aside during a protest in China. The Board rejected the claim and the applicant seeks a redetermination of the case. The court finds that the Board's negative inferences against the applicant's credibility were unreasonable and therefore grants the application for judicial review.
