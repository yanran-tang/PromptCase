The present case concerns the evidence of use of a mark required to be submitted to the Registrar of Trade-marks to register an official mark under the Trade-marks Act. Cable Control Systems Inc. (Cable Control) had received the registration of the trademark DIG SAFE & Design under Registration No. TMA791 850. Cable Control objects to the publication of the Official Mark because by its publication Cable Control's trademark is no longer entitled to the same degree of exclusivity conferred on registered marks by s.Â 19 of the Act. However the judge found that it was reasonable for the Registrar to accept the Spring 2010 Newsletter as evidence of ESA's adoption and use of the official mark.
