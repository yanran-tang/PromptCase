The case is about an Iranian citizen who claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution based on his political opinion. The Board found him not to have a credible testimony and the applicant challenged this decision. The reviewing court refused to interfere with credibility and plausibility decisions but found that the Board erred in setting up a narrow test for the kinds of political groups that could exist and not considering the matter from the perspective of the persecutor. The matter was referred back to a differently constituted Board.
