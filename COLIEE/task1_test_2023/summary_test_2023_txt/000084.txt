The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by an immigration officer to deny a family's application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The officer considered factors such as country conditions in Mexico the applicants' degree of establishment in Canada their relationships and familial ties in Canada and the best interests of the children. The court found that the H&C decision was reasonably open to the officer with respect to both the best interests of the children and the applicants' establishment in Canada.
