The court has allowed an application by the defendant to strike the plaintiff's statement of claim without leave to amend. The plaintiff was seeking damages following his release from the Canadian Forces (CF). However the court authorized the filing of a new statement of claim and gave the plaintiff 60 days to do so. The facts of the case suggest that the plaintiff had issues with his training and was ultimately recommended for compulsory release from the CF.An anonymous plaintiff has filed a lawsuit against the Canadian government over a 2011 incident where the person was allegedly detained and tortured in Syria. The plaintiff claims that Canadian officials were complicit in their arrest and torture. The lawsuit claims the plaintiff suffered physical and psychological injuries from the torture as well as loss of income and the out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of the incident. The Canadian government has denied any wrongdoing in the matter.
