This article discusses a judicial review of a complaint filed by Suzanne Dubois against the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) for discrimination on the grounds of sex and perceived mental disability. Ms. Dubois alleged that she was discriminated against by several managers at CIDA. An investigator was appointed who concluded that the evidence did not support the allegations and thus the complaint was dismissed. The article emphasizes the importance of investigating all complaints even those without obvious merit to ensure that the voices of marginalized individuals are heard.CIDA dismissed a complaint about treating Ms. Dubois unfairly and failing to provide her with a harassment-free environment due to her gender disability and retaliation because the evidence did not support her allegations. Ms. Dubois appealed the decision arguing that the Commission's decision was unreasonable or violated natural justice. The court reviews the issue and notes that the Commission is entitled to a high degree of deference unless there are procedural irregularities or a lack of evidence supporting their decision.
