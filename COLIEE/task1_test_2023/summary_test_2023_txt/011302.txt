Édutile a small business that sells price guides for used cars and trucks brought an action for copyright infringement against the Association a non-profit organization for the protection of vehicle consumers. Édutile claimed that the Association's publication of a used automobile price guide infringed its copyright but the court ultimately ruled that Édutile's work was not original and therefore not protected by copyright and that the Association's work did not reproduce a substantial part of Édutile's work even if it had been protected.
