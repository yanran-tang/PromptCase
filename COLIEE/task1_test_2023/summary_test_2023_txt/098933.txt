The applicant seeks judicial review of two decisions by the National Parole Board of Canada one revoking her day parole and another denying her application for day and full parole. The applicant is serving life in prison for a second-degree murder conviction in 1978 and had several breaches of her conditions during her 18-month day parole stint. She was suspended from day parole in December 1992 and has remained incarcerated since then.An applicant for parole in Canada had her day parole revoked after she refused to provide urinalysis to Correctional Services officers who claimed they received information that she was at a bar with other parolees. The applicant argued that no reasonable and probable grounds were provided for the request. The Board revoked her day parole for presenting an undue risk to society based on her criminal history including a previous conditional release violation involving impaired driving resulting in a young boy's death. The Appeal Division affirmed the decision and the Board later refused the applicant's request for reinstatement of day and full parole.
