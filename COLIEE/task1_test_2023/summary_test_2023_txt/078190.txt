An application for judicial review was made after the Canadian Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness denied Dwayne Grant's request for a transfer of his sentence having been found guilty of international drug trafficking. After receiving an acceptance from the Costa Rican authorities transfer requests from Dwayne Grant's traveling companions were approved but Dwayne Grant's application was denied based on the belief he may after the transfer commit a criminal organization offence. The first decision was set aside and sent back for redetermination.ide whether to consent to the transfer of a Canadian offender imprisoned abroad. Section 10(2) of the International Transfer of Offenders Act requires the Minister to consider whether the offender will commit a terrorism or criminal organization offence after the transfer. A Federal Court recently set aside a decision by the Minister to deny a Canadian offender's request for transfer and ordered reconsideration.
