A Sri Lankan police officer Ponnampalam Kathiripillai has had his application for a permanent resident visa in Canada rejected due to his alleged complicity in crimes against humanity. He denies the allegations but a visa officer determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe otherwise. Mr. Kathiripillai claimed that the visa officer erred in a number of ways but his application was dismissed.Mr. Kathiripillai's application for permanent residency in Canada was rejected due to reasonable grounds to believe that he is a member of the inadmissible class of persons described in paragraph 35(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. This is based on concerns about his involvement in interrogations and use of force during his work with the police in Sri Lanka which could constitute a violation of human or international rights. Mr. Kathiripillai was found to be evasive and inconsistent during interviews and the applicable standard of proof in this case is based on facts arising from omissions.
