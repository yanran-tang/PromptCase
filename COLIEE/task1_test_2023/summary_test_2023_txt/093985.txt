Jose Cabatu Espinosa a citizen of the Philippines applied to become a permanent resident of Canada as a skilled worker but was denied due to his score being one point below the threshold. Espinosa argued that the officer's assessment was unreasonable and that the officer wrongly failed to exercise his discretion to grant the application even though he was one point short. The court allowed Espinosa's application for judicial review and ordered a reassessment of his application by a different officer.
