A family from the Czech Republic claimed refugee status in Canada due to being persecuted because of their Roma ethnicity. They presented evidence of constant threats and attacks by skinheads who were supported by the police and courts. However the Immigration and Refugee Board concluded that the applicants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution and denied their refugee claim. The family applied for judicial review of this decision.The family of Czech Roma including the principal applicant experienced multiple incidents of racist attacks and threats from skinheads. One incident resulted in the father being stabbed in the back and losing his job due to the injuries sustained. Their son was also beaten by skinheads while the police failed to intervene resulting in the son being sentenced to community service. The family faced difficulty in finding legal representation and the death of Mrs. Spacilova's father is suspected to be a murder.The Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board has denied asylum to Czech refugees claiming persecution in their home country stating that there is adequate state protection in the Czech Republic. The Board also rejected the plaintiffs' motion to have their case reviewed due to bias against Czech refugees on the part of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.The Czech Republic is a democracy with strong state protection and there are legal protections for the rights of the Roma people including anti-discrimination and hate legislation. The judicial system has adequately protected the applicants in this case as there were investigations and convictions for the attacks. The Board found that the police and judicial system carried out their proper duties and that the applicants had not exhausted all their recourses for protection in the Czech Republic before seeking asylum in Canada.
