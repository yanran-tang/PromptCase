The case involves an application for a judicial review under s. 18.1 of the Federal Court Act by Mr. Markevich a British Columbia resident who failed to pay taxes in the early 1980s on income earned in the promotion of stocks. The Revenue Canada office later decided to write off the amount of tax still owed by Markevich but this did not extinguish the debt. In 1998 Markevich was informed that he owed more than $770583.42 in unpaid taxes including the tax he had failed to pay in the 80s. The principal question in the case is whether there is a limitation period on the Minister's exercise of the statutory collection powers.Revenue Canada included previously written-off tax debts in statements of account sent to taxpayers and requirements to pay. The applicant was worried that this inclusion would harm his business when communicated to his debtors. The respondent argued that the court did not have jurisdiction over the matter as the informative letter from the Minister was not a decision or order. However the court determined that the permitted subject-matter of the application for judicial review was broad and could include administrative action other than decisions or orders.This legal case involves a challenge to the validity of the issuance of a requirement to pay unpaid tax debts. The court rules that the letter from Revenue Canada signified a decision to collect the debt and intended to take measures to recover it making it reviewable as an act or proceeding. The court also notes the potential damage to a taxpayer's reputation from such requirements and highlights the lack of a remedy to challenge their validity. They refer to various statutory provisions including the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act.
