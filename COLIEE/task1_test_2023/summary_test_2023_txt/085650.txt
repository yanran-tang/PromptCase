The case involves a Tamil citizen from Sri Lanka who fears persecution from the Sri Lankan army and police. The applicant's claim for refugee status was denied by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) due to a negative credibility finding despite the RPD stating that credibility was not in issue. The court found the decision to be a denial of natural justice and ordered a redetermination by a differently constituted panel.
