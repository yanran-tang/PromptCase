Chang Fu Hsu a citizen of Taiwan appealed the decision of Citizenship Judge Barbara Scott who denied his application for Canadian citizenship. The issue in this appeal was whether the judge erred in her interpretation or application of the legal test to determine the applicant's eligibility for citizenship. The judge blended two tests and there was no evidence that she addressed the issue of connection to another country. The appeal was allowed and Hsu's application for Canadian citizenship was approved.
