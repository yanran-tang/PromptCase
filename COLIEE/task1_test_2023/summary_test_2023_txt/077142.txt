Eugjen Brace who had amassed 12 criminal convictions since immigrating to Canada in 2001 was ordered to be deported after being convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment of at least ten years deemed inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality. In this case Brace appealed to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) to consider humanitarian and compassionate factors including his criminal history and family ties in Canada but his appeal was dismissed. Brace's subsequent judicial review was also dismissed by the Federal Court.
