One of the defendants Celtic Shipyards has brought a motion for inspection of the steering system of the tug Sea Cap XII after it struck their facility in the Fraser River. The inspection is needed urgently as the value and relevance of any observations made may become less valuable over time. The owner of the tug argued that inspection should wait until mid-September but the court ruled that inspection should be carried out now with appropriate safeguards in place.
