The case concerns an application made by Syntex Inc. under s. 6(1) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations. Syntex is challenging Notice of Allegation made by Nu-Pharm Inc. that none of Syntex's patents would be infringed if Nu-Pharm were to sell flunisolide nasal solution. Syntex claims that the patents relate to a hemihydrate polymorphic and crystalline form of flunisolide that is used in nasal sprays for the treatment of inflammation of human nasal mucosa referred to as Form A. The 228 patent which includes claims to various polymorphic crystalline forms of flunisolide including the ideal hemihydrate Form A flunisolide expires on April 8 1997.Nu-Pharm argues that Syntex's patents on Form A flunisolide do not meet the requirements for inclusion in the Canadian patent list. The patents include claims for pharmaceutical compositions chemical solutions and processes related to Form A flunisolide but do not claim the medicine itself or its use. Nu-Pharm argues that the Regulations only allow for patents related to the medicine or its use to be included in the list. They base their argument on a distinction between medicine and drug under the Regulations.Nu-Pharm alleges that only the original patent for flunisolide reflects a claim for the medicine itself while Syntex argues that its four patents also claim the medicine. Syntex challenges Nu-Pharm's evidence and argues that its patents are properly on the patent list. The court considers whether Nu-Pharm can pursue the recourse contemplated by the regulations based on its allegation against Syntex's patents.
