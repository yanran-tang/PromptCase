The plaintiff seeks to amend their statement of claim to add claims for copyright infringement of their literary work the Love Buggy Owner's Manual and their Huggable stroller design as a work of artistic craftsmanship. The defendant opposes the motion arguing that it is unjust to rely on registrations obtained after the action was commenced. However the court allows the amendment stating that the claims are intimately connected to the issues before the court and the defendant will not face significant additional burdens. The court also disagrees with the defendant's attack on the sufficiency of the affidavit and leave to amend is granted.
