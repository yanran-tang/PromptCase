The applicant appeals against the decision of the Citizenship Judge who denied her citizenship application due to not fulfilling the minimum 1095 days of residence required by the Citizenship Act. The Judge found the applicant was absent for 727 days and present in Canada for 733 days resulting in a shortfall of 362 days. The Judge's decision was found to be reasonable due to the regularity substantiality and ongoing nature of the absences. The appeal was dismissed with costs.
