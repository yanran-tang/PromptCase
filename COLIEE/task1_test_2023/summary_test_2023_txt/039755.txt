Czech and non-Roma was supportive of her and their daughters and helped them escape persecution. However the PIF stated that he had physically assaulted her and their daughters and that he did not support them. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected their claims for refugee protection stating that there was no evidence of state-sponsored or condoned discrimination or violence against Roma in the Czech Republic. The Applicants sought to set aside the decision on the grounds of bias legal errors and unreasonable assessment of evidence. However their application was dismissed.The Board did not believe that the significant events the principal Applicant alleged happened to her and her children actually happened finding her to be generally lacking in credibility. The Board concluded that the Applicants failed to rebut the presumption of state protection and dismissed their claims. Counsel for the Applicants requested a recusal stating they perceived a pre-disposition on the part of the judge to deny their application.The judge rebutted the applicant's concerns about bias stating that there is a high test to be met when alleging bias and the similarities between the case at hand and a previous case did not indicate bias. The judge emphasized that being consistent in exercising one's judicial responsibilities based on the interpretation of the law is not biased.The judge in the case at bar has addressed allegations of bias based on past decisions he made in similar cases. He concludes that while an informed person may believe he would approach similar cases consistently this belief does not necessarily indicate bias. The focus of his assessment will be determining if there is a factual evidentiary or legal basis for reaching a different conclusion in this case. The cases relied upon by the applicants are distinguishable.
