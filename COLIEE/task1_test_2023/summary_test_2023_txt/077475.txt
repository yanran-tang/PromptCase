This case involves an appeal by the Crown which sought to strike the plaintiff's statement of claim. The plaintiff's claim is based on a breach of contract alleging that the Crown's management plan for Banff National Park prohibited the plaintiff from obtaining a business license and thus breached contractual obligations. The judge agreed with the prothonotary's decision that the action was not a collateral attack on an administrative decision but rather a claim for breach of contract and dismissed the Crown's appeal with costs to the plaintiff.
