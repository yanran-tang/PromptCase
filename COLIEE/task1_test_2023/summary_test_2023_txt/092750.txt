On April 26 1995 Procter & Gamble Inc. and The Procter & Gamble Company filed a Statement of Claim against Colgate-Palmolive Canada Inc. alleging infringement of their Canadian Letters Patent and claiming damages an injunction and other relief. The plaintiffs also filed a Notice of Motion for an interim or interlocutory injunction to restrain Colgate-Palmolive from selling offering for sale manufacturing or distributing fabric conditioning articles which they claim infringe on their patent. The plaintiffs argue that there is a serious question to be tried that the defendant is violating their patent rights the balance of convenience favours them and irreparable harm will be done unless an injunction is granted.The plaintiffs have filed evidence in the form of affidavits from experts Rodolfo Delgado a chemical engineer specializing in fabric softeners and marketing consultant James Miller. The defendant did not provide any counter-evidence but attempted to challenge the credibility of the plaintiffs' experts through cross-examination. The court accepted the plaintiffs' evidence and acknowledged that Delgado and Miller are experts in their respective fields.The court heard from two experts in the case Miller and Delgado. Miller a marketing expert had experience in analyzing consumer and market variables and had provided consulting services on market issues. Delgado was an expert in research and development of fabric softeners and oversaw a team in North America. He stated that Procter & Gamble never gave samples of new products to competitors for review before launch. The judge accepted the evidence of both experts but noted that Miller could have better informed himself on some issues.
