An 85-year-old Sri Lankan Tamil widow was rejected for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) despite presenting a case whereby she claimed she would face serious risks if removed from Canada including extortion and abduction from the LIberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) the security forces and general conditions of insecurity affecting Tamils in Sri Lanka. The Federal Court overturned the decision as it did not identify what evidence it relied upon did not sufficiently explain decisions or examine available evidence and is problematic in several aspects. The matter was remitted for re-determination by another officer.
