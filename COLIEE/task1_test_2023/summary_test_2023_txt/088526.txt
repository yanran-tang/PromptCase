This is a motion for an extension of time or direction regarding a request for judicial review of the Registrar of Trademarks' decision to accept Icewine as an official mark used by the Vintners Quality Alliance. The applicants Magnotta are affected by this decision as they manufacture and sell icewine and claim to be the market leader in Canada for this product. They allege that the registration of Icewine as an official mark is the desire of their competitor Inniskilin to regain their lost market share.The case involves a dispute between Magnotta a wine-producing company and the VQA a voluntary trade organization over the use of the term Icewine as an official mark. Magnotta claimed that the mark is a descriptive product name and that the VQA is not a public authority. Despite Magnotta's opposition the Registrar granted the VQA's request for an official mark which Magnotta only learned about after the fact. The case raises questions about the extent to which trade organizations can claim exclusive rights to descriptive terms.
