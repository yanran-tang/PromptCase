Monarch Marketing Systems applied for an interlocutory injunction to stop Glenwood Label & Box from manufacturing using or selling ink rollers and label rolls for Monarch’s label guns and from using Monarch's trademarks. Monarch’s label guns dispense labels from rolls of labels called label rolls which are inked by ink-impregnated cylinders called ink rollers. The court found that Monarch did not establish irreparable harm and since damages would be a sufficient compensation Monarch failed to establish irreparable injury and an interlocutory injunction was not granted.
