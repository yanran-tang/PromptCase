The applicant sought to overturn a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) that found him not to be a Convention refugee. The applicant's claim for refugee status was based on the assertion that he was being sought by the military in Honduras because his brother had deserted the army and was perceived as being a guerilla. The applicant challenged the CRDD's decision on two grounds: it made several significant errors in its construction of the evidence and in its findings of implausibilities and it applied an incorrect burden of proof. The court found that the CRDD had made a significant error in its treatment of the factual evidence and that it had relied on incorrect assumptions regarding the burden of proof. The court therefore quashed the CRDD's decision and remitted the matter for rehearing by a different panel.
