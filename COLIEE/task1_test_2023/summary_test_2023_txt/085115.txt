This is a case of judicial review of a decision made by the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The case involves a citizen of India who was convicted of robbery and the use of an imitation firearm and was issued a deportation order. The Minister applied to discontinue the respondent's appeal but the IAD dismissed it on the basis that the respondent did not receive a term of imprisonment of over two years. The court found that the IAD erred by not considering pre-sentence custody which is credited towards a person's criminal sentence and granted the application for judicial review. The matter was remitted for rehearing by a differently constituted panel and a question was certified.
