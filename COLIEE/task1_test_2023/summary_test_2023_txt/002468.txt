This is an appeal from a decision to expunge a trademark belonging to Guido Berlucchi & C. S.r.l. The Registrar requested evidence of use of the trademark in Canada and the applicant filed an affidavit stating that 300 bottles had been sold to Brunello Imports Inc. However it was disputed whether the trademark was actually used on the bottles sold. The Registrar concluded that she was not satisfied that the trademark had been used in association with sparkling wines and expunged the registration. The applicant contests this decision.Canadian court has reinstated the registration for a trademark by Italian wine company Berlucchi after their trademark was challenged for non-use in a three-year period. The case debated whether a single sale of Berlucchi wine to Brunello Imports in 2001 qualified as a use of the trademark in the ordinary course of trade. The hearing concluded the trademark was still in use and should remain on the register. The burden of proof in s.45 proceedings falls on the trademark owner and requires a prima facie case of use with an affidavit that shows use through describing facts. Evidence of a single sale must be contextualized to avoid doubt while the normal course of trade may be inferred from evidence. Ultimately the trademark must match the one used to identify the same goods.
