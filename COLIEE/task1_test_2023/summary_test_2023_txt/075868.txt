The case involves an applicant who was a specialist officer-dental in the Canadian Forces and maintains that he never agreed to serve for an indefinite period. However the respondents claim that all specialist officers who pursued a career as a dentist before 1988 served under an indefinite period of service. The dispute affects the amount of the applicant's annuity and he seeks judicial review of the decision denying his request for redress of grievance. He has since obtained his voluntary release.In a legal case concerning a Canadian officer who was denied conversion of his terms of service it was found that a number of administrative errors were made by the personnel department. The officer's personnel record was eventually corrected and he was offered a conversion to a special indefinite period of service which he accepted. The case highlights the importance of accurate record-keeping and administrative processes in the military.
