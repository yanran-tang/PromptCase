This unedited case concerns an application for judicial review of a negative decision taken by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The applicant Sehlule Nyathi claims a well-founded fear of persecution from the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) due to her political opinion as a member of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The Board found her narrative to be incredible and her claim was ultimately rejected. Nyathi raised two issues on judicial review both of which were dismissed.
