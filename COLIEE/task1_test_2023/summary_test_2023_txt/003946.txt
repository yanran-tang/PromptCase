In this case the applicant a Canadian citizen applied to sponsor her Serbian parents for permanent residency in Canada but the visa officer denied the application due to her father's poor health. The Immigration Appeal Division upheld the decision and the applicant sought judicial review which was ultimately dismissed. The court found that the IAD properly considered all relevant evidence and did not err in rejecting the applicant's proposed arrangement to privately pay for her father's medical costs. The court also declined to certify any questions of general importance.
