J. Mactavish dismissed a case where an Italian citizen residing in Canada Loreto Lorenzo Ferri challenged the constitutionality of s. 68(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act under ss. 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Immigration Appeal Division concluded that s. 68(4) deprived them of jurisdiction to decide questions of law including constitutional validity limiting their jurisdiction to determining factual requirements. Mr. Ferri's application for judicial review was rejected.Mr. Ferri's appeal which challenged the IAD's decision that it did not have the jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of s. 68(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was terminated. The only issue was whether the IAD erred in its decision. The relevant statutory provisions include sections regarding inadmissibility on grounds of serious criminality appeals to the IAD and the IAD's jurisdiction. The appropriate standard of review for the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal to decide constitutional questions is correctness.
