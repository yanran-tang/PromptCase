The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Immigration and Refugee Board which determined that the applicants citizens of Uruguay were neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The principal applicant is a member of a well-known and influential Uruguayan family and alleged persecution due to her family's political affiliations. The Board found that state protection would be available to the applicants in Uruguay which was upheld by the court.
