Michael Aaron Spidel a prisoner at Ferndale Institution in British Columbia sought judicial review of a decision that required him to choose between two paid jobs within the prison. The decision was based on a prison policy that no prisoner could hold more than one paid position. Spidel argued that he was not seeking to obtain double the inmate pay for holding two positions as the Regulations preclude such double dipping. The court found that no exceptional circumstances existed to justify departing from the general proposition that an applicant ought to exhaust his or her available remedies within the grievance process before coming to the court. The application for judicial review was dismissed without prejudice to the right to bring a judicial review at the conclusion of the grievance process.
