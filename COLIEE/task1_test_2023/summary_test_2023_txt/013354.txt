International Chartering Services Ltd. applied for leave and judicial review of a decision to assess them for costs related to dealing with stowaways who arrived in Vancouver on the Espirito Santo in 1992. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration attempted to strike out the application but was unsuccessful and the case will proceed to a full hearing.The court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case for review because there is no decision to review. The Minister argues that filing certificates is an administrative procedure not a decision subject to review. The applicant argues that the certificates may be unlawful and their status as a transportation company is in question. The court should proceed to a hearing rather than dismissing the case as there are conflicting views and evidence that should be heard.
