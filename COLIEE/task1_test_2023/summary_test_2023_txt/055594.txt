He was denied under a provision that prevents undeclared dependents from being later sponsored as members of the family class. A review found that the officer made a reviewable error in determining that it was in Gurpreet's best interest to remain in India. The primary issue raised was the sufficiency of the best interests of the child analysis and procedural fairness was also questioned regarding the officer's interview process.This legal document discusses a case involving a foreign national named Gurpreet who made an application for permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The document examines whether the best interests of a child were considered in the decision-making process and outlines guidelines for determining the best interests of a child in overseas applications. The document ultimately concludes that the procedural concerns raised do not constitute a breach of due process.
