The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by a Citizenship and Immigration Canada Officer denying the applicant's permanent residence application on the grounds that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to warrant an exception allowing the application to be made from within Canada. The applicant argued that the officer misapplied the H&C test and erred in assessing both establishment and risk factors. However the court found that the officer's decision was reasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
