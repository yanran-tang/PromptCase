Alexander Cardin's application for Canadian citizenship was rejected due to not meeting the residency requirement of accumulating three years of residence in Canada in the four-year period before the application. The Citizenship Judge applied the Pourghasemi test which asks whether the applicant has been physically present in Canada for a total of 1095 days in the last four years to determine if the applicant has been Canadianized. However the Federal Court found this finding to be unreasonable and Mr. Cardin's citizenship application was remitted for re-determination. The court noted the conflicting jurisprudence surrounding the appropriate test for residency requirements in citizenship cases and called for legislative reform in this area.
