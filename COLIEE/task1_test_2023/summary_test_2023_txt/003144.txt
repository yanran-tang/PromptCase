Pfizer Canada Inc. and Pliva d.d. are seeking a court order to prohibit the Canadian Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance (NOC) to Apotex Inc. regarding 250mg azithromycin capsules until the Canadian Patent on the product has expired. The respondent Apotex made a Notice of Allegation to issue NOC before the expiry of the patent to enable sales under provincial programs. The court proceedings were started on July 20 2000 and affidavits were filed by Theresa Firestone and Diane Azzarello.The court case involves a pharmaceutical company seeking approval to list their generic drug on provincial formularies. The company argues that this is not a violation of patent law as it is a regulatory requirement and not marketing or selling the product. The court is considering the requirements for obtaining a listing and the purpose and effect of provincial formularies. Both the applicant and respondent have submitted expert affidavits explaining their positions. Relevant legislation includes sections 55.2(1) 55.2(2) and section 5 of the Regulations to the Food and Drugs Act.The Patent Act of Canada provides exemptions for use of a patented invention related to development and submission of information required under any law as well as for manufacture and storage of articles intended for sale after the expiration of a patent. For drugs the Act requires a person filing a submission for a notice of compliance to either accept that the notice will not issue until the relevant patent expires or make allegations that the patent is invalid or not infringed upon.
