The appeal concerns the defendant's attempt to deduct losses from his horse racing operation for taxation years 1980-1985. The Minister of National Revenue restricted his losses to $5000 per year pursuant to s. 31(1) of the Income Tax Act. The plaintiff argues that farming was not the defendant's chief source of income and that his accounting business cannot be considered subordinate to the farming operation. The defendant argues that his chief source of income was a combination of farming and accountancy and that farming was the centre of his attention and major preoccupation. Both parties agree that the leading case concerning farm losses envisages three classes of farmers and that the defendant falls into Class I.In a taxation case the court must determine whether a taxpayer is a Class I farmer who can deduct all farm losses sustained or a Class II farmer who is restricted in the amount of losses he can deduct. This determination is based on the relative and objective basis of the taxpayer's chief source of income which involves assessing time spent capital committed and actual and potential profitability of various income sources. In a combination case of farming and another revenue source farm losses will only be fully deductible if farming represents the taxpayer's major preoccupation. The connection between a taxpayer's various sources of income is not necessary for classification as a Class I farmer.
