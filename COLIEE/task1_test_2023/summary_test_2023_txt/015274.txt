The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by a PRRA officer rejecting the application of Derege Lemma Woldegabriel for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). The court dismissed the application finding that the officer did not err in attaching minimal weight to the declaration of the applicant's father in failing to consider evidence suggesting the applicant was at risk in Ethiopia as a suspected supporter of an opposition party or in failing to consider evidence suggesting the applicant was at risk in Ethiopia as a young male.
