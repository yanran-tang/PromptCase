The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission in which it concluded that the applicant was out of time to file a complaint and that it lacked jurisdiction on certain matters raised in the complaint. The applicant sought an order setting aside the decision of the commission and further relief. The court found that the commission's decision was not patently unreasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review with costs to the respondent.
