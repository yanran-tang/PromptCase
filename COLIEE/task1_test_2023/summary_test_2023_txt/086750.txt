The court is considering an action for declaratory relief to have a ministerial decision quashed in relation to the plaintiff's application for permanent landing in Canada under a section that deals with compassionate or humanitarian considerations as grounds for departure from the usual immigration rules and procedures. The plaintiffs who are a Filipino husband and wife with two children have been illegal de facto residents in Canada for a number of years and have established themselves in the country.The Cabalfin family who entered Canada illegally in 1986 applied for landed immigrant status on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in 1988. They had been living together with the husband's parents in Vancouver for three years and the children were enrolled in school. However the family's original visa application from Manila contained misrepresentations and their immigration application was left in abeyance for months while more information was sought. Ultimately the family's application was denied due to the misrepresentations.The case involves the Cabalfin family who were denied permanent residency in Canada due to an immigration officer's belief that they had entered and remained in the country illegally through an organized plan. The immigration officer cited the family's violations of the Immigration Act and false passport use as reasons for exclusion from consideration. The plaintiffs' counsel argued that the officer failed to exercise his discretion properly and interpreted the defendant's policy improperly resulting in an unfair decision.
