The applicant is a refugee claimant who was refused asylum in Canada due to doubts over her Somali nationality. Her subsequent Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) application for refugee protection was dismissed on the grounds that the evidence she presented did not meet the requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The applicant challenged this decision in a judicial review which found that the officer's conclusions were not reasonable and the matter was remitted back for a new determination by a different officer.
