Ronald Collins a citizen of St. Vincent claimed to have a fear of persecution by the United Labour Party (ULP) and applied for refugee protection in Canada. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected his claim stating that he failed to rebut the presumption that adequate state protection would be available to him in St. Vincent. Collins appealed but the Federal Court upheld the Board's decision stating that they had properly applied the legal test for state protection and found that adequate protection was available in St. Vincent. The court declined to certify Collins' proposed question for certification.
