This is a case where the applicant sought a judicial review of the decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) to exercise its discretion to deal with a complaint of discrimination on the grounds of physical and mental disability. The respondent had been employed by Sears Canada and SLH Transport until 2009 and applied for the position of Operations Manager in 2005 but was not successful. In 2010 the respondent filed a human rights complaint and the CHRC determined that it would exercise its discretion to extend the filing period regarding the events of 2009. However the CHRC failed to take into account that the respondent was represented by counsel and neglected to consider all the relevant factors. Therefore the court granted the application for review and quashed the decision of the CHRC.
