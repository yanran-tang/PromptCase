Mollie Narcisse a citizen of St. Lucia filed a judicial review against a decision by a pre-removal risk assessment officer that rejected her application on February 24 2006. She claimed that she faced persecution if she returned to St. Lucia because of her abusive ex-boyfriend Henderson Clark. The PRRA officer rejected her application stating that she would not be subjected to persecution danger torture risk to life or punishment. The applicant submitted new evidence but it was not considered.The applicant's PRRA application was denied due to insufficient evidence of a change in her situation and her failure to address credibility concerns. The government of St. Lucia was found to be able and willing to offer her state protection. The applicant's arguments focused on whether the officer considered the best interests of her Canadian-born children and whether the PRRA officer's decision should be set aside for lacking an enforcement officer's notes. The court rejected both arguments.
