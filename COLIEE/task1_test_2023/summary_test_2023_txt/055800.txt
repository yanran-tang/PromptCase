An application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada is currently pending.ed in the previous case the Court of Appeal had referred the matter back to the Trial Judge for clarification and redetermination of damages. However the parties were not able to agree on the interpretation of the Court of Appeal's reasons. The Trial Judge ordered that Kraft first file and serve its motion record with respect to clarification and redetermination of damages which was heard along with Euro Excellence's motion to introduce new evidence. The Trial Judge ruled that no new evidence should be allowed and redetermined that Kraft be awarded damages in the amount of $300000 with interest. Euro Excellence must be given credit for interest to the extent that Kraft had Euro Excellence's money in hand.
