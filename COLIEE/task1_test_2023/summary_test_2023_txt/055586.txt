Mr. Mohammad Zilani a citizen of Bangladesh and a Shia Muslim sought judicial review of a decision of a panel of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board that he was not a convention refugee and was not a person in need of protection. The Federal Court Mainville granted the application as the decision did not meet the standard of reasonableness lacking explanations in support of its findings and those explanations it did provide were not consistent with the evidence on the record. The matter was returned for a new hearing and a new determination before a different panel of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board.
