The defendant in a patent infringement case sought a stay of proceedings until after a pending action against the company that purchased its allegedly infringing division was resolved. The defendant claimed that it no longer had personnel with relevant knowledge and all records had been transferred to Cummings Point. The court denied the stay finding that the plaintiff had a right to examination for discovery and the defendant failed to demonstrate that a representative could not obtain the necessary information. The court extended the time for discovery arrangements.
