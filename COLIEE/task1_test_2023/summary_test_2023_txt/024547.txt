The case concerns the interpretation of ss. 36(1) and 64(1) and (2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The issue is whether pre-sentence custody which is credited towards a criminal sentence is included in the term of imprisonment under s. 64(2). The Respondent was sentenced to three years with six months to be served in custody after pleading guilty to possession of cocaine for trafficking. The Immigration Appeal Division found that the Respondent was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least two years as required by s. 64(2) and therefore did not lose his right of appeal. The court held that the IAD's decision was made in reviewable error of law and fact and set it aside. The matter was referred to a differently constituted panel for redetermination.
