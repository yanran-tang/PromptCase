This is a case of judicial review where the applicant is requesting to set aside the decision of the adjudicator who denied his grievance for being terminated from his job as an air traffic controller for disciplinary reasons. The applicant believes that the adjudicator erred in denying the grievance and failed to apply legal principles concerning mitigating factors when considering the penalty of discharge. The relevant provisions from the Air Traffic Services Administration Management Manual and the Manual of Air Navigation Operations are discussed and the standard of review for decisions of the Public Service Staff Relations Board is explained.The case involves an applicant who disputes the findings of an adjudicator on his credibility in relation to leaving work early. The applicant argues that the adjudicator did not follow the correct rule when assessing his credibility. However the court determines that the adjudicator has the power to receive and accept evidence as they see fit without being bound by strict rules of evidence like a court. Therefore the standard of review is lower and the court cannot accept the applicant's argument that the standard of correctness applies.
