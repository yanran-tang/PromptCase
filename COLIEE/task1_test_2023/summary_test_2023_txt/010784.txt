An Iranian family's application for permanent residence in Canada was denied due to misrepresentation of a material fact in the application. The principal applicant hired an unauthorized immigration consultant who included a fraudulent test result without the applicant's knowledge. The family was never given a copy of the application and did not progress until several years later when they were notified that their consultant was unauthorized. The family claims they were victims of fraud.An immigration consultant's client was found inadmissible for misrepresentation under subsection 40(1)(a) of the Act which prohibits misrepresenting facts related to a relevant matter that could induce an administration error. The applicant claimed she was unaware of the false document submitted but the officer deemed it not credible. The applicant later corresponded with the embassy asking for special consideration as a victim of a scam but was not reconsidered. The case questions whether the misrepresentation needs to be knowingly made and if the evidence submitted after the initial decision can be considered.
