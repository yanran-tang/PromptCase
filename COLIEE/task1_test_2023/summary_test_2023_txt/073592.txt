The defendants in a patent infringement case are seeking a separate determination of the issue of claim construction known as a Markman Proceeding under United States practice. The Canadian Patent No. 2106950 involves a mechanical device for removing the bark from logs and only one device is alleged to infringe. The defendants are seeking determination of the meaning of certain phrases in the patent. The court orders the issue of a separate determination of claim construction to be determined on a pre-trial hearing to be dealt with by the Case Management Judge in collaboration with the parties.
