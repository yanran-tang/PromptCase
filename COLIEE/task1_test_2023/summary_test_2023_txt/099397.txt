This case involves a young African American man whose complaint against TD Canada Trust for alleged discrimination based on race and color was dismissed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The incidents in question occurred when the Applicant attempted to make deposits at different branches of the Respondent and was subjected to questioning and treatment he believed was linked to his identity. An investigation followed and found no evidence to support the allegations. The case was taken to court for judicial review.The applicant lodged a complaint with the Commission alleging that he was treated adversely because of his race and color. The Commission investigated the conduct of the original investigator and reassigned the investigation to another investigator. The final Investigator's Report authored by the new investigator found no bias on the original investigator's part and summarized the applicant's allegations and the respondent's defense against them. The report also mentioned the applicant's claim of being racially profiled but did not expand on the concept.An investigation by the Canadian Human Rights Commission has found no evidence that a bank in Newfoundland discriminated against a customer on the basis of race. The individual had claimed that TD Bank staff had been condescending and aggressive due to his ethnicity but investigators concluded that it was company policy to scrutinise large deposits by unknown customers regardless of their race. The case highlights the difficulty of proving systemic racial profiling in individual cases.
