This case involves a woman Ms. Pannu who has lived in Canada since 1988 without legal status. Her previous two sponsors were deported and she made a third humanitarian and compassionate application for permanent residence which was refused in 2005. The case describes Ms. Pannu's history with her first sponsor her ex-husband who was convicted of multiple crimes and deported in 1995. Ms. Pannu made several claims for landing refugee status and post-refugee claim review all of which were rejected. The case involves a judicial review of the decision to refuse her H&C application.In 1999 a woman named Ms. Pannu was granted inland sponsorship to become a permanent resident in Canada after marrying her husband but her husband was later found inadmissible and ordered deported. Ms. Pannu made several claims to stay in Canada including an H&C application which was refused due to the officer's belief that severing ties with Canada would not have a significant impact on her. The officer also found that the risk/hardship allegations Ms. Pannu made were not valid and that her ex-husband's criminal record was not sufficient evidence of harm towards her. The officer conceded that the status of women in India was not ideal but that Ms. Pannu had not provided any evidence that she would be specifically at risk.
