Plaintiffs sought to strike out certain paragraphs and annexes in an affidavit by Harvey M. Shanefield but the Canadian defendants objected arguing that it was inappropriate to strike the affidavit due to the complexity of the historical issues and the agreed procedure for the case. The court rejected the motion stating that admissibility should be determined by the trial judge hearing the expedited issues in order to maintain the agreed order and schedule of the case.
