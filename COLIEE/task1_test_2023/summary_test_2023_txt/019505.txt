The case involves the denial of a humanitarian and compassionate exemption for a Pakistani family seeking to remain in Canada. The court refused to intervene in the decision as it falls within the range of acceptable outcomes. The family failed to satisfy the three-part conjunctive test for a stay of removal and their removal was deemed inconvenient but not causing irreparable harm. They had previously sought refugee protection PRRA and H&C consideration and reconsideration.This is a motion seeking a stay of removal until an application for leave and judicial review is decided. The decision to enforce the Applicants' removal order is from the Canada Border Services Agency. The style of cause is amended to add the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness as a responding party. The Court rejected the notion that hardship analysis is an improper lens for an H&C Officer to use and the use of hardship in an H&C officer's decision or wording does not indicate that the officer has fettered their discretion. Inherent in the notion of H&C applications is that hardship is a normal consequence of deportation proceedings.
