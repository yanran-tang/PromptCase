The applicants including Mr. A.B. were denied refugee protection by the Immigration and Refugee Board under IRPA sections 96 and 97. Mr. A.B. who was diagnosed as HIV positive and receiving anti-retroviral therapy in Canada claimed that returning to Zimbabwe would result in inadequate medical care and persecution. However the Board rejected all claims. Dr. Stan Houston confirmed that if Mr. A.B.'s illness was adequately treated he could continue to work and live in Canada.The case involves the interpretation of Canada's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act regarding the definition of a person in need of protection including those who would face torture risk to life or cruel treatment if returned to their country of origin or habitual residence. The applicants challenged the Board's handling of evidence and constitutional challenges to the Act's exclusion of health care and handling of risk to life issues. The Board found that one applicant met the requirement for membership in a particular social group afraid of persecution due to an unchangeable characteristic.
