The case concerns Mr. Aytac Ozunal a Turkish citizen who claimed refugee status in Canada in 2005. He refused to perform his military service as he is a conscientious objector. However the board did not find his aversion to military service sufficient to grant him refugee status. They also found that the punishment for refusing military service in Turkey did not meet the qualification for protection under IRPA sections 96 and 97. The court subsequently dismissed his application for judicial review.
