The plaintiff a former RCMP officer appealed against a decision by the Tax Court of Canada to dismiss his appeal from notices of reassessment issued by the Minister of National Revenue in respect of his 1980 1981 1982 and 1983 taxation years. The M.N.R. deemed the loss from the plaintiff's horse farming business to be $5000. Despite the plaintiff's experience with horses a number of horses were sold for considerably less than their purchase price due to injuries or being over-valued.The appellant a farmer appealed the reassessment of his losses to the Tax Court of Canada. The court held that the Canadian Minister of National Revenue (M.N.R.) properly restricted the appellant's losses to $5000. The defendant maintains that farming was not his main source of income and the court found that there can be no appeal from a nil assessment. Therefore the appeal was dismissed in respect of the 1982 and 1983 taxation years.
