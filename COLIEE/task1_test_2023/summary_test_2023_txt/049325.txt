The case pertains to the inadmissibility of Mr. Thaneswaran under paragraph 37(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act due to his alleged involvement with the V.V.T. gang. The Federal Court of Appeal determined that engagement in gang-related activities is a distinct ground for inadmissibility. The Board found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Thaneswaran was part of the gang-related criminal activity planned and organized by a group making him inadmissible to Canada.The Immigration and Refugee Board found Mr. Sinnarajah Thaneswaran a Sri Lankan citizen who had been living in Canada since 1994 inadmissible for a conviction for assault causing bodily harm and for involvement with a criminal organization known as the V.V.T. gang. Thaneswaran appealed the decision but the court found no errors and upheld the deportation order.he Board the Applicant objected to the admissibility of certain pieces of evidence which he argued were based on hearsay and lacked sufficient detail to establish his alleged involvement in organized criminality. The Federal Court of Appeal held that the Board did not err in failing to explicitly address these objections in its reasons as it had considered and weighed all the evidence before it and had explained its reasoning.
