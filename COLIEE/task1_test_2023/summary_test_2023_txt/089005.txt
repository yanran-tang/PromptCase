This case involves a judicial review application regarding a refugee claimant who arrived in Canada on the M/V Ocean Lady in 2009. The Refugee Protection Division found the claimant to be a refugee because of the risk he faced if he were to return to Sri Lanka. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration seeks to set aside the Board's decision arguing that it was based on an unreasonable or incorrect interpretation of the Refugee Convention.In a judicial review the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is challenging a decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) to grant refugee protection to a Sri Lankan Tamil claimant who arrived in Canada aboard the M/V Ocean Lady. The Minister argues that the claimant is not a member of a particular social group within the meaning of the Refugee Convention and that the RPD unreasonably determined that he might be at risk of torture if returned to Sri Lanka. The claimant argues that the Board's determination was reasonable and that he should be entitled to refugee protection under other protected grounds of the Refugee Convention including his Tamil ethnicity and the likelihood that he would be considered a member or supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In the end the court upholds the Board's decision to grant the claimant refugee protection.The Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) grants protected person status to those who would be subjected to a danger of torture or a risk to their life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to their country of nationality or habitual residence. The standard of proof required for a claim under section 97 of the IRPA is higher than that required for a refugee claim under section 96 of the Act. The case law is divided on whether the reasonableness standard should also be applied to the RPD's interpretation of the Refugee Convention as incorporated into section 96 of the IRPA.
