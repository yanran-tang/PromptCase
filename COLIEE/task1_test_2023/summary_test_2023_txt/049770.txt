This case involves an application for judicial review from an adjudicator's decision that the respondent who was unjustly dismissed from his job as a line manager at Sports InterAction should be reinstated with benefits. The adjudicator found that the company failed to investigate the incident properly and judged the respondent's credibility to be preferable to that of the company's witnesses. The company was ordered to compensate the respondent for all lost salary and benefits.The dismissal of an employee for inappropriate language and behaviour during internet chatting with colleagues has been overturned by a Canadian federal adjudicator. The adjudicator found that an immediate dismissal was excessive and that the incident should have been dealt with as part of progressive disciplinary measures. The adjudicator also criticised the sports betting company Sports InterAction for failing to investigate similar incidents that received no disciplinary action. The employee has been awarded reinstatement.
