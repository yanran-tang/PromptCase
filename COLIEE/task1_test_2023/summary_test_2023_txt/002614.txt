The case involved a conflict between execution of a removal order by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and a probation order of the Ontario Court (General Division). The court found that execution of the removal order directly contravened the probation order and therefore was in violation of Section 50(1)(a) of the Immigration Act. However the court did not order the Minister to return the applicant to Canada to continue his probation citing that Parliament did not enact Section 50 to benefit offenders but to provide direction in the case of conflict between orders made by the Minister and orders of other judicial bodies or officers in Canada.
