The Tobique Indian Band is seeking to convert their application for judicial review into an action or alternatively to amend the grounds in the Notice of Application and require officers of the Department of Indian and Northern Development to be examined. The underlying issue is a decision by DIAND to appoint a third-party manager to the Band due to their default on funding agreements and their efforts to find support for financial restructuring. Concerns were raised about the financial situation of the Band and a proposed debt consolidation plan.The Merchant Capital proposal was rejected in 2007 with the decision communicated orally and in writing to the applicant. The decision to appoint a third party manager was made due to the Council being in default of the DIAND/Tobique Funding Agreement. The applicant filed an Application seeking to have the decision quashed and declared restored to co-management. The case proceeded with extensive cross-examination on affidavits and the applicant sought to convert the Application to an action.
