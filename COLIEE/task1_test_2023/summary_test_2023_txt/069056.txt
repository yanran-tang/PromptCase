The plaintiff Oswan Tucker is seeking damages from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans for requiring him to choose between utilizing an inshore fishing license or an offshore fishing license. Tucker says the Minister exercised his discretion unreasonably or made a negligent misrepresentation causing him harm. The case hinges on whether it is unreasonable for the Minister to restrict the plaintiff from using both licenses at the same time. The court ultimately dismisses the plaintiff's claim.
