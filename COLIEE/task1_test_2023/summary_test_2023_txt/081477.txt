The case concerns Irina Griscenko's appeal against the refusal of her application for a permanent resident visa in the self-employed person class by a Visa Officer. The Officer found she did not meet the definition of a self-employed person under subsection 88(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations. The Court upheld the Officer's decision concluding that the Applicant did not meet the definition of a self-employed person and therefore did not qualify for permanent residency.
