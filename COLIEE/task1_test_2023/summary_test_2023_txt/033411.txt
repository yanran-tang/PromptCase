This is an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Minister of National Defence to withhold certain information in the personal file of a member of the Canadian Armed Forces which he determines to be personal information and exempt from disclosure. The applicant sought access to information on an offence committed by a Canadian soldier while on service in Somalia which took place in Croatia. The Access to Information Request Form was received by the National Defence Headquarters Access to Information Section on September 2 1993 and by letter dated February 16 1994 information was released to the applicant; however exemptions had been applied to some of the information pursuant to s. 19(1) of the Access to Information Act. The only question in issue is whether the decision to refuse disclosure to the applicant of the information exempt is justified pursuant to the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act. The burden of proof rests upon the party who objects to disclosure pursuant to s. 48 of the Access to Information Act. The information that was withheld included personal information and therefore the exceptions found in s. 3(j) of the Privacy Act are very specific and should be interpreted narrowly. The applicant submitted that since some documents were shown to the media s. 19(2)(b) is applicable rather than s. 19(1) under which the disclosure was refused; however the applicant did not persuade the court.
