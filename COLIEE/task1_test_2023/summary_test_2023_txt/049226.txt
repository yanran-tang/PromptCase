The applicant seeks to overturn a decision made by a Canadian Human Rights Review Tribunal in 1995 which allowed an appeal by the respondent James Russell Lambie who claimed that the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) discriminated against him by not appointing him as Commander of Canadian Forces Base Greenwood in Nova Scotia because of his marital status. The applicant argues that the CAF did not discriminate and Colonel Kirkwood was appointed on merit.The case involves a complaint by a Lieutenant Colonel in the Canadian Armed Forces who claims he was discriminated against in being denied a promotion. The First Tribunal dismissed his complaint but the Review Tribunal overturned the decision ruling that he had been discriminated against. The applicant now appeals claiming that the Review Tribunal made several errors in their decision.This passage discusses a legal case regarding a human rights complaint. The Review Tribunal heard additional evidence and had to assess it in light of the evidence presented before the First Tribunal. The Review Tribunal found that the First Tribunal had made errors in their decision and re-evaluated the evidence presented in light of the burden of proof on the complainant and respondent. Ultimately the Review Tribunal found that there was a discriminatory practice and upheld the complaint.
