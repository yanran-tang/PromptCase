The applicant applied for a disability pension which was repeatedly denied. He claimed an injury sustained during service caused his chronic cervical strain but there was no medical evidence of the injury until years later. The Veterans Review and Appeal Board refused to grant the pension due to the lack of medical evidence. The applicant sought judicial review of the Boardâ€™s decision.The case involves a former Reserve Force member Mr. Hall who applied for a disability pension due to his neck condition. The applicant and his physician claimed that the condition was caused by a fall in 1984 during service but the Minister's decision denied the application due to the lack of documentation or complaints during the period of service. The case highlights the challenge of establishing the causal relationship between a current medical condition and past military service.
