Mr. Quiroa and his wife had their application for permanent residence in Canada refused based on Humanitarian and Compassionate considerations. The Officer concluded that they were not exempt from applying for permanent residency from outside Canada and noted that the couple had not become established or financially independent enough to indicate sufficient hardship were they to be returned to Guatemala. The Officer also recognized the couple's connections to their home country.The case involves a couple who arrived in Canada as refugee claimants and later applied for permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The officer did not consider a letter from the couple's accountant and found that the couple would not face unusual hardship if they returned to Guatemala. The issues presented include whether the officer erred in her decision and whether the letter can be considered. The statutory framework of the IRPA allows the Minister to grant exemptions based on H&C considerations and the decision-making process is highly discretionary.
