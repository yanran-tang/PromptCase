This case involves a pre-removal risk assessment (PPRA) application made by Abraham Bahaty Bayavuge a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo whose claim for refugee protection was rejected due to his involvement in security forces. Bayavuge did not provide sufficient evidence to support his PRRA application which was subsequently rejected. The court found that Bayavuge was solely responsible for the rejection and could not blame the PRRA officer.nly specific grounds including Article 1F must be assessed under paragraph 97(1)(b) of the Act. The PRRA officer did not have to give Mr. Bayavuge a written assessment under subsection 172(2) of the Regulations. The issue is dismissed. (2) Could the PRRA officer reasonably reject Mr. Bayavuge's PRRA application in spite of the decision rendered by the Board in his case? The PRRA officer provided reasons for rejecting Mr. Bayavuge's application including that he did not specify the danger he faced in his country and did not submit any evidence of such danger. The issue is dismissed.
