The case concerns a nurse who had difficulty paying her taxes due to exceptional circumstances including the death of her husband and parents-in-law flooding in her home and her son's depression. Despite requesting relief from the Canada Revenue Agency's Taxpayer Relief Provisions her application was denied and she was assessed penalties and interest on arrears. The court found that the applicant's situation fell within the exceptional circumstances beyond her control referred to in the provisions and allowed her application for judicial review.
