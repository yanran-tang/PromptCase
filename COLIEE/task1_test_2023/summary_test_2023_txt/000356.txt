In 1992 Master Warrant Officer Ronald William McTague was hit by a car while crossing a road causing serious injury. His claim for a pension was rejected as it was not deemed to be directly connected with his military service. McTague filed for judicial review arguing that the injury should have been eligible for a pension under s. 21(2)(a) of the Pension Act. However the Board did not address the issue and the court found that McTague's injury did not fall under the specific situations in s. 21(3). The court concluded that the Board did not err in law and rejected the application.ng of the Act regardless of whether the individual was on duty at the time. The Board granted the rehearing and ultimately awarded the applicant a pension citing their obligation under the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act to interpret legislation in favor of veterans and their dependents.
