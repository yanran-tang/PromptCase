Mr. Verge Armoyan filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) had discriminated against him because of his race and ethnic origin. An investigator's report recommended that a Human Rights Tribunal investigate the complaint. However the Commission dismissed the complaint concluding that there was no evidence to support it. Armoyan challenged the dismissal but the court found that the Commission had not breached his right to procedural fairness or failed to provide sufficient reasons for its decision.
