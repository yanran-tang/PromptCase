The Wellcome Foundation Limited and Burroughs Wellcome Inc. sought consolidation of two court actions against Apotex Inc. and Novopharm Ltd. The plaintiffs wanted the court to declare that the zidovudine patent owned by Wellcome was invalid while the defendants alleged that Wellcomeâ€™s patent rights had been breached. The judge dismissed the application for consolidation but directed parties to arrange a pretrial conference to consider steps that could simplify and avoid duplication.
