The Attorney General of Canada is seeking to quash the Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision to allow a complaint by Ernest Boone which was time-barred. The Attorney General is also seeking to prevent any future enquiry into the complaint. The grounds for the application include allegations of breaches of procedural fairness and jurisdictional errors by the Commission. The complaint alleges discriminatory remarks were made by Brigadier-General Robert Martin towards Boone during discussions about transferring to the Law Society of Upper Canada whilst he was a member of the CF Postal Unit in Lahr West Germany.Boone's request for information regarding discrimination on the basis of age was responded to by a human rights officer who asked for a chronology of events. Boone later filed a formal complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission 14 months after the denial of transfer and 18 months after the alleged initial discriminatory comments were made. An investigator was appointed to submit a report on findings to the Commission. The CF took the position that the complaint was untimely due to the lengthy delay.The Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) received a complaint from Boone and recommended that it be dealt with under s. 41(e) of the CHRA even though the discriminatory act had occurred more than a year before. The CF was given an opportunity to provide submissions and submitted a request for more information which was denied by the CHRC. The CF's counsel sent several letters requesting information and a copy of the CHRC's policy on extensions of time under s. 41(e).
