is decision denies an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which stated that the applicants were not Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The applicants citizens of Chile had claimed persecution based on political opinions and membership in a particular social group but their claims were ultimately deemed unfounded. The decision also provides a detailed background of the principal applicant's experiences leading up to her claim of persecution.A woman from Chile received threatening phone calls and was attacked at knifepoint prompting her to request police protection and flee to Canada with her family. However the Canadian board found that there was only a mere possibility of persecution if she were to return to Chile and that the police cannot provide protection if she is unable to provide evidence of the threats and their connection to her work. The board denied her claim for refugee status in Canada.
