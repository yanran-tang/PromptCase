Hermes Ccanto a citizen of Peru claimed to be a Convention refugee on the basis of his political opinion and membership in a particular social group. The Tribunal determined he did not have a credible basis for his claim and the subsequent deportation order was made. Ccanto sought an order setting aside the Tribunal's decision and referring the matter back to a differently constituted Tribunal. The court dismissed the application finding the Tribunal had reason to decide as they did.
