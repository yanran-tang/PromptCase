The Native Council of Nova Scotia (NCNS) and three individuals claimed that the Canadian government broke their duty to consult with them over fishing agreements with the 13 Indian Act Chiefs in Nova Scotia in a case to promote aboriginal law. The defendants attempted to strike out the statement of claim arguing that none of the paragraphs pleaded a reasonable cause of action but the judge struck out the entire statement of claim with leave for the plaintiffs to submit an amended version. The NCNS were removed as a party and the plaintiffs must establish that they have the same interests with all other off-reserve Mi'kmaq in the amended document.
