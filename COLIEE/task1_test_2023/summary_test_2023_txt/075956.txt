The Federal Court granted leave to Apotex to file an affidavit in response to affidavits filed by Bayer in proceedings under the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations. The affidavit concerns the issue of preliminary steps in the Apotex process which Bayer contends are relevant to the question of infringement of its patent interests. The court exercised its discretion to permit the filing of the affidavit in reply where it would serve the interests of justice assist the court and not seriously prejudice the other party.
