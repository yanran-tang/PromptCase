This case involves an application for judicial review by the Attorney General of Canada regarding the decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) to investigate a complaint by Jennifer Ann Burnell under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Attorney General argues that the complaint is based on inaccurate facts the CHRC failed to conduct a proper investigation and the decision to investigate a complaint from ten years ago is unreasonable and prejudicial. The relief sought includes an order to quash or set aside the CHRC's decisions and an injunction to prevent them from carrying out an investigation. The relevant provisions of the Act prohibit employment discrimination based on certain grounds and allow individuals to file a complaint with the Commission.This case involves a complaint filed in 1994 by Jennifer Ann Burnell with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) alleging discrimination in her employment by the Department of National Defence (DND) on the basis of a perceived disability ulcerative colitis. Burnell claimed that she was forced to sign a memorandum containing negative comments about her performance and personal life and was continually criticized and harassed despite her satisfactory performance reviews. She filed a grievance in January 1986 but was threatened by her superiors if she did not drop it and request a voluntary release. The CHRC has the power to not deal with complaints if certain conditions are met such as if a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament has not been exhausted.
