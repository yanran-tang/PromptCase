The plaintiffs allege that they are lawfully entitled to money paid in lieu of cattle pursuant to Treaty No. 7 and that the money ought to be divided on a per capita basis among all members of the Blackfoot Band. The defendants seek to have the claim struck out on the grounds that it is an abuse of the process of the court or otherwise falls within one or more of the subheadings of Rule 419. The defendants also argue that the court does not have jurisdiction over the claim. The applications are dismissed.
