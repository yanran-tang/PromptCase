The case involves an application for judicial review by a Haitian refugee claimant who fled Haiti due to targeted violence against her family seeking protection in Canada. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board denied her claim on the grounds that there was not a sufficient nexus between the persecution she feared and the Convention grounds. The claimant argued that the Board's decision was unreasonable but the Court dismissed the application for judicial review finding that the Board's decision was reasonable. There was no certification of the question submitted by the claimant.
