This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board denying the applicant refugee status. The issue before the court was whether the Board committed a reviewable error in its assessment of the applicant's credibility. The court found that the Board's decision was not patently unreasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
