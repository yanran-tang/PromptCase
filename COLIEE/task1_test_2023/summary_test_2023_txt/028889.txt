The case concerns a judicial review of a refusal of a requested humanitarian and compassionate exemption (H&C) for inland processing of parents for permanent residence in Canada. The applicants originally from Russia made a refugee claim based on membership in a social group before filing their applications for permanent residency seeking an exemption for inland processing. The central issue is the reasonableness of the refusal and the factors taken into account by an immigration officer when considering the interest of children in granting such an exemption.The case revolves around the immigration status of the Mayburov family who fled persecution in Moldova and were temporarily residing in Israel before coming to Canada. They filed for refugee status and later made a humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) appeal on the grounds that they had a Canadian-born child and deep roots in Canada through family ties. However the immigration officer did not find sufficient grounds to process their inland application and suggested that Mr. Mayburov needed a job validation to qualify as an independent immigrant. The Refugee Division and CIC also rejected their claims.
