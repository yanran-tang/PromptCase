The case is about a Chinese citizen who claims to be a member of Falun Gong and fears persecution in China. She arrived in Canada in 2011 and filed for refugee status but her claim was denied by the Refugee Protection Division based on credibility issues. The Applicant seeks judicial review of the decision.The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected an application for asylum by a Chinese citizen who claimed to fear persecution due to her practice of Falun Gong. The RPD found that the applicant had not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution and that there was no evidence to suggest that she would continue to practice Falun Gong if returned to China. The applicant appealed the decision arguing that the RPD had applied the wrong test in assessing her claim and had misapprehended the evidence.
