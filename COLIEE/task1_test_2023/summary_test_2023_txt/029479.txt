Rocky Mountain Ecosystem Coalition filed two applications for judicial review related to the Alliance Pipeline System Project. The first seeks to set aside the decision of the National Energy Board regarding the project while the second seeks mandamus relief regarding the project's environmental assessment. The Attorney General of Canada has filed a motion to strike out both applications arguing that the Federal Court lacks jurisdiction and that the NEB Act provides for discretion in how functions are performed.Rocky Mountain's application to review the decision of the National Energy Board (NEB) regarding Alliance's pipeline system has been deemed improper by the court. The AGC argues that the court does not have jurisdiction to hear the application and the relief sought is not available at law. Rocky Mountain's motions seeking affirmation of their applications' jurisdiction are deemed moot and their second application seeking mandamus relief is struck out. The NEB's approval of the pipeline project is subject to comprehensive study and consultation with interested parties.A non-profit organization Rocky Mountain participated in a 77-day National Energy Board hearing in Calgary concerned about the environmental impact of running pipelines beneath streams and rivers. They claimed that discussions about this drilling method between Alliance and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) were held outside the formal hearing process and not made available to other participants. Rocky Mountain's requests for Alliance to produce witnesses with knowledge of the discussions were denied. The NEB denied Rocky Mountain's motion to adjourn the hearing to receive information from DFO.
