The case involves a dispute over band membership in the Ermineskin Indian Band No. 942. The plaintiffs seek a declaration that they are entitled to receive all benefits that have been received by members of the band an accounting of all benefits and general damages plus interest. The claim alleges joint and several liability on the part of the Crown and the Ermineskin defendants. The Ermineskin defendants argue that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear a claim by an individual against the Band Council based on a breach of fiduciary duty or trust obligation. The court rules that there is a potential for conflicting claims and that it is not plain and obvious that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the claims that the Ermineskin defendants seek to have struck out.
