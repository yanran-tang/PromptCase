The plaintiff appealed a decision to deny their request for a complete publication ban on Court File T-461-10. The prothonotary had found that the request was too broad and lacked sufficient evidence of harm or prejudice that would result from public access to the information. The Federal Court dismissed the appeal finding that the prothonotary had identified the applicable principles of law and did not err in applying them. The appeal was dismissed.
