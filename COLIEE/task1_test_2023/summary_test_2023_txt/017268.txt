Indigo applied for judicial review of a decision by the Trademarks Opposition Board refusing to allow amended statements of opposition in opposition proceedings against Clarks’ trademarks INDIGO and INDIGO BY CLARKS. Indigo sought an order quashing or setting aside the Board’s decision or directing the Board to allow the amendments to the statements of opposition. The proposed amendments pleaded a new ground of opposition alleging that Clarks could not have been entitled to use the trademarks in Canada which would depreciate Indigo’s goodwill.e Board erred in its refusal to grant leave for Indigo to amend its statements of opposition as it failed to consider the significance of the new ground of opposition and the potential prejudice to Indigo if the amendment was not allowed. However the Court must first determine if it has jurisdiction to review the Board's interlocutory decision and what standard of review is appropriate.The court has reviewed an interlocutory decision of the Board and found that there were legal errors which made the decision unjustifiable. The Board erred in failing to consider a request for leave to amend statements of opposition not considering the explanation for the delay misapprehending the prejudice to the parties and not considering the concern of inconsistent decisions being issued. The court also found that the appropriate standard of review was reasonableness. Clarks submits that special circumstances do not exist in this case and that Indigo has other remedies available to it.
