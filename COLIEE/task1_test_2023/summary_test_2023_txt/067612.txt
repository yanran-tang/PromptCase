This case relates to an appeal by Pharmascience Inc. and a cross-appeal by Abbott Laboratories and Abbott Laboratories Limited. The hearing followed an order by Prothonotary Aronovitch that granted Abbott's motion for an extension of the 24-month period specified in the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations by 105 days dismissing Pharmascience's motion to shorten the period. The relevant provisions of the PMNOC regulations were also discussed.This case is about the expiration of a patent and the application of PMNOC regulations. The court finds that the 24-month period specified in Paragraph 7(1)(e) of the PMNOC Regulations would have expired on the 5th of July 2004. The Minister of Health didn't file any materials or appear before the court and Pharmascience filed a motion to strike the matter which was granted but then later reinstated by the Federal Court of Appeal.The appeal concerns a motion by Abbott for an extension of the 24-month period for filing a Notice of Allegation against the drug company Pharmascience which had filed a cross-motion for shortening the same period. Prothonotary Aronovitch's decision is under review and the standard of review for discretionary decisions by a prothonotary is established. The matter was heard on the merits in Toronto in July 2004.
