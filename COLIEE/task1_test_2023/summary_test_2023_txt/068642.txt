The plaintiffs seek a declaration that they have been members of an Indian band since a particular date and are entitled to receive all benefits that have been received by members of the band as well as future benefits. The claim also alleges joint liability between the Canadian government and the band defendants. The Ermineskin defendants sought to strike out certain parts of the claim arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction and that they did not owe a fiduciary obligation to the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the plaintiffs' claim.
