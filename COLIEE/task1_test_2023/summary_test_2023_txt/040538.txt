The case concerns a visa officer's decision to reject an application for an immigrant visa from a Russian citizen who listed her intended occupation as a general economist. The issue is whether the visa officer erred in law by not assessing her in this occupation which was the basis of her application. The court rules that the applicant was entitled to be assessed in the occupation she stated in her application and that the visa officer erred in not conducting such an assessment in accordance with the Immigration Act and Regulations. The matter is remitted for redetermination by a different visa officer.
