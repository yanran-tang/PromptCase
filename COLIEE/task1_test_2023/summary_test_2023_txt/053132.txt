The case involves a family from Albania the Muratis who fled to Canada and claimed refugee status due to being victims of a blood feud. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected their claim stating that they had not made sufficient efforts to obtain protection in their own country and that an internal flight alternative was available to them. The RPD relied on principles regarding state protection and considered evidence from a variety of sources ultimately concluding that the applicants had not refuted the presumption of state protection in Albania.
