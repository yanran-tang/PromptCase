The appellant in a trademark registration appeal has been denied an enlargement of time to file evidence due to significant delay and lack of excuse according to a court ruling. The appellant took over 14 months to produce affidavits in support of their appeal and had not shown any good reason for the delay leading to the motion being dismissed. The importance of an orderly process of appeals was deemed more significant than the potential value of the affidavits.
