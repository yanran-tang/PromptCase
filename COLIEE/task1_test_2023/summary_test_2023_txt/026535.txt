The case concerns the rejection by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Applicant's claim of refugee protection on the ground of gender as a victim of horrific abuse at the hands of her boyfriend in Mexico. The RPD rejected her claim on the basis that she did not do enough to seek protection from the police in Mexico but the court found that her unwillingness to access state protection in Mexico with respect to the violence she suffered is reasonable and set aside the RPD's decision.
