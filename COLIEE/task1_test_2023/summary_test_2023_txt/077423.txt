This is a case of judicial review brought by a former member of the Canadian Armed Forces who challenges their release from service. The applicant had a history of misconduct including alcohol misuse rude behavior and absence without leave. After a report recommending their release was completed the applicant objected to it and sought copies of the information sent to Ottawa but was only able to obtain it through the Privacy Act. The Court will consider the applicant's request to be reinstated with full pay and benefits from the date of their release.This case involved the dismissal of a military officer who challenged his release in court on the grounds that the officer who made the decision lacked the authority. The case was dismissed with the understanding that the recommendation would be reconsidered but the officer was later suspended without the opportunity to be heard. A career review board recommended his release but the applicant was not invited to attend or be represented and the Director General approved the decision without giving the applicant an opportunity to address him. Several issues arose including whether the military's internal grievance procedure was exhausted and what material was relied upon by the Director General.
