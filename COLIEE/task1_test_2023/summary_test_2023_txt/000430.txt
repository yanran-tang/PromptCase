The case involves Abd Dayem Ould Liman a citizen of Mauritania who claimed asylum in Canada due to his political opinion. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board refused to recognize him as a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The court found that while the panel did not err unreasonably in its analysis of the evidence it was concerning that they outright dismissed nine documents without adequate explanation. Nonetheless the court dismissed the application for judicial review.
