Oladimeji Aremu Sofela sought a stay against his deportation during his application for permanent residency in Canada. The officer assessed the application and determined that the applicant had used a fraudulently obtained document to enter Canada which renders them inadmissible. The court found that the decision denying his application for permanent residency raised a serious issue but the evidence provided by Sofela's affidavit to establish irreparable harm was not sufficient and the stay of deportation was dismissed.
