The case involves Ganna Syvyryn a Ukrainian citizen who claimed refugee protection in Canada due to fear of abuse from her common-law spouse. The Immigration and Refugee Board determined that she was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection as she had an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Kiev Ukraine. However the Federal Court found that the Board's analysis of the second prong of the IFA test was inadequate and did not take into account the Gender Guidelines which highlight the discrimination faced by women seeking employment in Ukraine. The matter was sent back for re-determination by a different panel of the Board.
