Ms. Charlene Cox a paralegal employed by the Department of Justice in the Aboriginal Law Section in British Columbia applied for judicial review of a decision by Mr. William McDowell Associate Deputy Minister who denied her grievance over an unsatisfactory Performance Review Employee Appraisal Report. After a mediation session the report was revised to incorporate a more positive tone but the overall global rating remained at 2. The court found that the ADM's decision to deny her grievance was reasonable and dismissed the application.
