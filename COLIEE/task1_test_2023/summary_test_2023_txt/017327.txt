The case involves a married couple both citizens of Cuba who left Cuba legally but failed to return within the time specified in their visas. They claimed refugee status in Canada fearing persecution at the hands of the Cuban authorities. However the Refugee Division gave a negative answer to their claims stating that the violation of the term of the exit permit did not satisfy the requirements of the definition of Convention refugee. The couple sought judicial review of this decision arguing that they would face imprisonment if they returned to Cuba and that this constituted persecution. However the court ultimately upheld the negative decision finding that the punishment for their offence did not amount to persecution under the relevant principles of law.
