The applicants seek to quash the decision made by the Minister of Health to de-list their patent for PREVACID a drug used to treat ulcers from the Patent Register due to changes in eligibility requirements. The Canadian Patent Office accepted the patent which claims the use of solvent-free lansoprazole crystals in the treatment of ulcers and the patent was properly listed under the old regulations. The applicants argue that their patent meets the eligibility requirements and should be restored to the Patent Register.The case discusses the removal of the 053 Patent from the Patent Register by the Minister through the authority given under subsection 3(2) of the New Regulations. The reasons given were that the patent did not mention the treatment of NSAID ulcers and claimed a polymorphic form of lansoprazole which is not eligible for listing on the Patent Register under the new regulations. The case discusses the differences between the old and new regulations and addresses two main issues namely the Minister's authority to delete the patent and whether the patent meets the eligibility requirements under the new regulations.This article discusses the interpretation of the New Regulations in the context of the Notice of Compliance Regulations. The provisions at issue are subsection 3(2) and paragraph 4(3)(c) of the New Regulations and section 6 of the Regulations Amending the Patented Medicines. The court's approach to statutory interpretation is cited emphasizing the importance of considering the entire context and intention of Parliament. The article also mentions the transitional provision of section 6 which sets a cutoff date for the application of the New Regulations.
