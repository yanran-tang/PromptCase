The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board wherein the board determined that the applicant was not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The Board made its decision based on the applicant's inability to adequately establish his identity. However the court found that the Board did not make a reasonable assessment of all the evidence submitted by the applicant including additional identity documents with official stamps and remitted the matter for re-determination by a newly constituted Board.
