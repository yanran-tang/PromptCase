The union representing airline employees of Air Canada has applied for a judicial review after an Appeals Officer under the Canada Labour Code decided there was no jurisdiction to hear an appeal over a determination of an officer that a danger did not exist in the workplace. The case concerns the merger of Canadian International Airlines into Air Canada and disputes over the creation of a new Manual and health and safety procedures. The union also alleges that the investigator appointed under the provisions of the Part II of the Canada Labour Code was not fair impartial or unbiased.The union alleges that an investigator's report which was essentially adopted by the Health and Safety Officer of Transport Canada is biased and procedurally flawed as the investigator only spoke to Air Canada representatives not the union or flight crew employees. The Health and Safety Officer concluded that there was no evidence of Air Canada contravening their duty to protect the safety and health of their employees. The union filed an appeal but an Appeals Officer stated that they cannot review an AVC accepted by a health and safety officer.
