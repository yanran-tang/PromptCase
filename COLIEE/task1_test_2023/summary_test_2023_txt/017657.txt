The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division stating the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The applicant claimed to be a citizen of China and feared persecution due to his membership in the underground Christian church. The Board decided that the applicant was unable to establish his identity based on insufficient documentation. The case was allowed for a re-determination by a newly constituted Board.
