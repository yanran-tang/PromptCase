This case concerns the adoption of Vaneet Sharma a child in India who was adopted by Chaman Jit Sharma and his wife. The Canadian authorities denied Vaneet's application for permanent residence in Canada prompting judicial review of the decision. The first issue was whether the adoption was valid under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 1956 which the court found to be a question of fact and law that did not warrant intervention. The second issue concerned whether the adoption created a parental relationship which the court found had not been fully examined by the Appeal Division and thus required reconsideration.
