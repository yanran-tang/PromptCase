Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly filed a motion in Canadian federal court to set aside an order from a prothonotary that certain questions from Novopharm need not be answered during a discovery related to an action for patent infringement. The patents claimed processes to make intermediates of the medicine nizatidine and Novopharm counterclaimed that they are invalid. Lilly alleged that Novopharm was refusing to answer relevant questions. The judge found that the prothonotary did not commit any reviewable error and dismissed the motion.
