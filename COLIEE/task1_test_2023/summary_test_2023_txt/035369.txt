The case involves a judicial review of the decision of the Appeal Division which held that Kuldip Kaur is not a member of the family class within the meaning of the Immigration Regulations 1978. The applicant argues that the panel erred by examining the authenticity of the adoption and finding that the evidence was not indicative of a genuine parent/child relationship. However the court determines that the Appeal Division was correct in their assessment of the factual circumstances surrounding the purported adoption which did not create a genuine parent/child relationship. The application is dismissed.
