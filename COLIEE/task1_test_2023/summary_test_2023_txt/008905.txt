Action Express Ltd's application for judicial review pertains to the decision of adjudicator Dan R. Cameron regarding a complaint of unjust dismissal by Shelly Lesy against the company. The adjudicator awarded Lesy seven months pay in lieu of notice. The company alleges that the decision should be quashed or set aside and referred to a new adjudicator. Lesy was a truck driver for Action Express Ltd which has contracts with Canada Post in southern Saskatchewan. She had repeatedly requested a salary increase but her attempts to contact her employer were unsuccessful.In a letter to her employer the Respondent expressed frustration with her current position stating that she deserves better and that her dedication to the job is waning. After a phone conversation with her employer in which there were conflicting reports of tone and language the Respondent sent a second letter in which she seemingly quit her job demanded compensation and interest and offered to stay only if her demands were met. The employer was shocked by the letter and felt that the Respondent had resigned. He also expressed concern about her potential mistreatment of the company's delivery truck and her negative impact on relations with a key client.Employee was terminated for cause by her employer Action Express Ltd and subsequently appealed her dismissal under s. 240 of the Canada Labour Code. The Adjudicator found that the employee did not resign but was terminated for cause due to insubordination specifically her insolent and disparaging letters about the company's management and major client. The Adjudicator determined that the employer had just cause to impose a disciplinary sanction but questioned whether her termination was appropriate.
