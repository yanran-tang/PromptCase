In a case regarding the death of a fisherman the court rules that the plaintiff should receive compensation based on the provision of household services during the joint lives of the fisherman and his wife. The court also apportions 70% of the fault to one defendant and 30% to the Crown and awards increased costs to the plaintiff due to the lack of honesty from some witnesses and unreasonable allegations from the defendants. The court rejects the argument that the plaintiff should only recover 85% of her costs due to her husband being partially at fault for the accident.
