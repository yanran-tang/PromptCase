The applicants sought to quash a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which found that they were not convention refugees. The male applicant claimed refugee status due to his support of the pro-democracy movement before and during the Tiananmen Square massacre in China and feared persecution as a result. The applicants operated a printing shop and printed flyers and posters in support of the movement. When the applicant printed posters about the massacre instead of ones previously ordered they went into hiding and subsequently fled to Canada.The witness testifies that he and his employees printed 10000 flyers for a pro-democracy rally and distributed them with the help of a man named Wong Wai Ming. He later learned that Wong had been arrested by Chinese authorities and that his materials had been found in Wong's dormitory. The witness did not know how the materials ended up there.
