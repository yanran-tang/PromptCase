This is a case of an application for judicial review of a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Officer's decision regarding the identity of an applicant claiming to be a 70-year-old citizen of Somalia. The Refugee Protection Division rejected the applicant's claim in 2003 due to insufficient credible evidence to establish identity and the PRRA Officer concluded in 2005 that there was insufficient evidence to establish the applicant's nationality. The court found that the PRRA Officer erred in both rejecting new identity evidence and finding that the evidence was too general to establish identity and referred the PRRA application to another officer for re-determination.
