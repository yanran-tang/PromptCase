The Lloyd George Morgan case involves a Jamaican citizen who faces deportation from Canada due to the rejection of his refugee claim. The applicant seeks a stay of the deportation order and argues that he has a constitutional right to a risk assessment before removal from Canada. The court ultimately dismisses the applicant's stay application finding that there were no sufficient grounds to warrant deferral of the applicant's removal.
