This case involves an application for judicial review of a refusal by a visa officer to grant a permanent residence visa for Canada. The decision was challenged on grounds related to the assessment of the Educational Training Factor (ETF) and the officer's use of discretion. The case examines the relevant sections of the Immigration Regulations 1978 and National Occupational Classification to determine the appropriate ETF points for a chef.The court case deals with an applicant's challenge to the refusal of his visa application for Canadian permanent residency. The court ruled that the applicant was not entitled to the required number of points for completing an apprenticeship program but was awarded points for his work experience and qualifications as a chef. The applicant argued that the visa officer should have exercised discretion to issue a visa despite not meeting the required points but the court ruled that there were no exceptional circumstances to warrant such an exercise of discretion.
