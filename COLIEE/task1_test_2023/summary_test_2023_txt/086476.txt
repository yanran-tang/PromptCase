The applicants Gurdeep S. Khalon and his nieces Bhupinder Kaur and Rajinder Kaur brought a written motion to overturn the refusal of the female applicants' applications for permanent residence in Canada on the basis of humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The visa officer also rejected their applications on the same basis after discovering inconsistencies in their affidavits. The court dismissed the application as it found no reversible errors or bad faith in the visa officer's decision-making process. No questions were certified.
