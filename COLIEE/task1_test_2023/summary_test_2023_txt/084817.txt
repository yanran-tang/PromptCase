The case is about an application for a judicial review of a decision made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The applicants were found not to be Convention refugees or persons in need of protection because of their fear of guerrilla forces in Venezuela. The Board rejected the applicants' claim for refugee protection on the basis that there was no more than a mere possibility that they would face persecution if returned to their home region in Venezuela and that a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) existed in Caracas Venezuela. However the Court found that the Board erred in its analysis of both issues and ordered the matter to be remitted to a different panel of the Board for re-determination.
