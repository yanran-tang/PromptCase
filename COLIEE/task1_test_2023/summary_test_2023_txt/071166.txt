The case involves an applicant who claims to be a citizen of Rwanda and to have a well-founded fear of persecution based on her membership in a particular social group the Diaspora Tutsi. The Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board declared the applicant not to be a Convention refugee. The court finds that the Board acted reasonably in dismissing the applicant's claim for refugee status and the application for judicial review is denied.
