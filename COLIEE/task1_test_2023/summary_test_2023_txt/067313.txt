Bruce Levy appealed his unsuccessful candidacy for a position at an EX-01 group and level at the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. Levy contested the merit principle of the competition and sought access to documents to support his challenge. The appeal board's decision to deny Levy access to the documents was quashed on the grounds of evidence and standards of disclosure. The matter was referred back to another panel of the Public Service Commission Appeal Board for a new hearing with directions to order access to the requested documents.
