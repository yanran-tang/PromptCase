This case is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board where the applicant seeks an order to set aside the decision and have the matter referred back to the VRAB. The applicant claims a disability pension due to a 1958 military road accident that caused neck disease which was found to be age-related and not connected to his military service. The VRAB refused to reconsider the VAB's decision in light of new medical evidence prompting this review.The case involves a war veteran who had been seeking compensation for a neck injury he claimed was caused by a car accident in 1958. The original decision by the Entitlement Board was based on the absence of any record of a neck problem between 1958 and 1988. The veteran submitted new medical evidence from three physicians but the Veterans Review and Appeal Board refused to reconsider its earlier decision in 1994 and 1996.The applicant requested a reconsideration of a Veterans Appeal Board decision based on new evidence from Dr. Murdoch. The Veterans Review and Appeal Board rejected the request stating that the evidence was speculative and did not outweigh previously considered medical evidence. The applicant claimed that the VRAB committed jurisdictional and procedural errors including incorrectly interpreting the legal test for reconsideration of an earlier decision. The issue was whether the VRAB erred in refusing to reconsider the decision in light of the new evidence.
