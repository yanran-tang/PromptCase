McDowell applied for leave to file an amended Statement of Opposition against Automatic Princess Holdings which was refused by the Trademarks Opposition Board in 2014. McDowell requested a judicial review of the Board's decision which was also refused by the court. The court held that there were no special circumstances to justify judicial review before the administrative process was complete and that there were adequate remedies available within the administrative process. Costs were awarded to Automatic in the amount of $3500.
