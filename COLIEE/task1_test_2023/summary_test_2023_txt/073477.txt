Her Majesty the Queen seeks an order for the plaintiff Sameer Mapara to give security for the Crown's costs in this action amounting to $15430.78. The Crown also requests that the plaintiff be prevented from taking any further steps until the security requested has been paid into court. The motion was granted and the reasons for the decision were discussed. The plaintiff a federally incarcerated inmate claims damages against the Crown following his placement in administrative segregation in Mission Institution's secure custody unit for a 20-day period in June 2012. The plaintiff alleges wrongful imprisonment by the Warden negligence in fulfilling the Warden's statutory duty and breaches of his Charter rights.The Crown brought a motion for security of costs against the plaintiff who has initiated multiple unsuccessful legal proceedings against them. The plaintiff argued that he was impecunious and unable to provide the requested security. The court considered his financial situation including reliance on his disabled wife and his own lack of income as a prisoner and ultimately dismissed the Crown's motion.The court is considering a motion brought under Rule 416 for security for defendant's costs. The plaintiff has admitted to owing costs to the Government of Canada in relation to other litigation matters but argues that the Crown has misstated those obligations. The only dispute is whether the plaintiff has met the test for avoiding giving security for costs under Rule 417. The plaintiff must demonstrate impecuniosity with full and frank disclosure of financial information but has only provided some institutional financial statements which the court finds falls short of the required standard.
