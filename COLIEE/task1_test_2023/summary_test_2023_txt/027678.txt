Mr. Dave applied to sponsor his wife's permanent residence application but was refused as his wife was not considered a member of the family class. The Immigration Appeal Division dismissed his appeal stating that Mr. Dave had an obligation to declare his change in marital status and failed to do so thereby precluding his wife from being examined and sponsored. The court held a reasonableness review of the interpretation of IRPA and the Regulations.The Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) adjourned a case for the applicant to amend their memorandum after the appellant argued that the IAD erred by not considering a policy and that a paragraph of a statute was inconsistent with section 7 of the Charter. The relevant statutory provisions were also listed.
