The plaintiff who is representing himself seeks a declaration that the Minister of Justice did not properly consider his request for mercy pursuant to s. 617 of the Criminal Code. He alleges that his conviction was based on fabricated and perjured evidence and argues that there is fresh evidence that the photograph used as evidence was doctored. However the court finds that his complaints are not well-founded and dismisses the case. The court notes that the ministers of justice had properly reviewed his applications for mercy and that the plaintiff had not submitted the necessary materials.
