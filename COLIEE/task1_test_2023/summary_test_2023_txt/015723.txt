The Laurentian Pilotage Authority a federal Crown corporation filed an action for a declaratory judgement seeking to waive compulsory pilotage under s.5 of the Laurentian Pilotage Authority Regulations after its contract with applicant a licensed pilot who refused to renew the contract expired. Applicant brought a motion to strike out the action claiming it served no practical effect and the respondent had no valid interest or interpretation of the Regulations. The Court ruled that there was no question of legal interpretation in issue and the action for a declaratory judgement would be devoid of practical effect since the Authority made a decision and acted on it and respondent had no valid interest and the court had no jurisdiction to make a declaration of fact.
