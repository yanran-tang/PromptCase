This case involves a couple from Colombia Liliana Velez and Rodrigo Emiro Gutierrez Rodriguez who claimed refugee status in Canada in 2008 due to fear of harm from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Their claim was rejected by the Refugee Protection Division in 2009 and they sought to have the decision set aside based on alleged errors including the failure to conduct a separate analysis under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. However their application was dismissed by the court.Ms. Velez and Mr. Gutierrez both claim to have been threatened and coerced by the FARC in Colombia. Ms. Velez was forced to provide a list of investors in her co-operative and threatened with being declared a military target if she did not comply. Mr. Gutierrez was demanded to provide information about the children he drove on his bus and beaten when he refused. Both fled to the US.
