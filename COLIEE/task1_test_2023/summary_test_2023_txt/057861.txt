The applicant submitted an application to the Canadian Consulate General in Los Angeles in 1991 under the Investor class category but the application was refused by the visa officer. The visa officer stated that the applicant did not meet the business experience component of the category. The applicant's counsel argued that the visa officer erred in law and jurisdiction and did not conduct proceedings in accordance with the requirements of procedural fairness. The court concluded that there was an error of law and a denial of procedural fairness and referred the matter back for redetermination.
