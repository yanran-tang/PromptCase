The case involves an application by a Jamaican citizen who is seeking an order to stay her removal from Canada. The applicant has a criminal record for theft fraud and failing to appear offenses. She was also convicted of attempted abduction in 2002 and her appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division was dismissed. The applicant's request for a stay of removal was dismissed as the court found that she had failed to establish a serious issue would not suffer irreparable harm and the balance of convenience did not lie in her favor.
