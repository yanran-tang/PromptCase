The applicant was serving a 15-year sentence at Donnacona penitentiary until he was recommended for transfer to the Special Handling Unit (SHU) at the Ste-Anne-des-Plaines penitentiary due to his involvement in a serious assault institutional drug trafficking intimidation and influence peddling. The Correctional Service of Canada relied on preventive security reports to support their decision to transfer him. The applicant is seeking to have these decisions set aside.The case involves an inmate named RÃ©mi Cartier who was being transferred from one prison to another due to security concerns. However he objected to the transfer claiming he did not receive enough information from the correctional service. A team assessed his case and ultimately recommended that he not be admitted to the S.H.U. for assessment. Later it was discovered that Cartier had participated in an assault on another inmate and the preventive security reports were used to justify admitting him to the S.H.U. The applicant planned to make representations to the National Review Board in person.The applicant was recommended for admission to the S.H.U. by a case management team and the National Review Board approved the recommendation citing his involvement in an assault and drug trafficking. The applicant challenged the decision arguing that the initial transfer from Donnacona was illegal and that he did not receive enough information to prepare a defence. The grounds for the two applications for judicial review were identical. The court was informed that the applicant had abandoned the third ground.
