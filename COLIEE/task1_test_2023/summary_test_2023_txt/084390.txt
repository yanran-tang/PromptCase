This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by a visa officer to deny an individual permanent residency in Canada as a skilled worker. The applicant requested a substituted evaluation which allows the officer to override the point system but the officer refused. The court found that the officer's decision was reasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
