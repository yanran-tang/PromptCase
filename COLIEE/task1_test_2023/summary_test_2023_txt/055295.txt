The case deals with whether Pashko Razburgaj his wife Lule Razburgaj and their daughter Juljana Razburgaj are in need of protection as refugees from Albania due to two blood feuds. The Refugee Protection Division found their credibility lacking and that state protection is available in Albania. The court found no reason to disturb the Board's decision as it met the test of reasonableness. Only the claim under paragraph 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was considered.The applicants originally from Albania claim that their return to their country would put them at risk of harm due to blood feuds their family is involved in. The family had been attempting to reclaim land they believed was rightfully theirs which led to violent confrontations. They unsuccessfully sought asylum in the United States on the basis of their political opinions and entered Canada illegally in 2010. They claimed for protection but were denied as the threat they face does not meet the requirements for refugee status.
