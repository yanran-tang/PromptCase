The Attorney General of Canada asked the court to set aside the Review Tribunal's decision declaring that Ms. Vinet-Proulx was entitled to Old Age Security benefits from July 2002 and the court ultimately decided that the Review Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction in awarding benefits retroactively from before May 2003. The court allowed the application for judicial review and restored the Minister's revised decision. However the Attorney General of Canada promised to process any application made by Ms. Vinet-Proulx under section 32 of the Act quickly.
