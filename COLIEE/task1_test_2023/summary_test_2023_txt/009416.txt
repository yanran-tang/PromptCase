The applicant filed for a stay of a deportation order which had been issued against him on February 27 1992 arguing that his fear of being killed or tortured if he was returned to El Salvador was the foundation of his application for refugee status. The respondent argued that the court had no jurisdiction to grant a stay and that the applicant had not demonstrated that the circumstances of his case met the requirements for the issuance of a stay. However the court accepted the applicant's argument that a challenge to the validity of the decision finding no credible basis to his claim for refugee status indirectly challenges the validity of the deportation order. The court granted the stay order.
