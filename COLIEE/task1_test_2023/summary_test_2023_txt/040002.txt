This case is about Mr. Serkan Etiz a citizen of Turkey who argues that he should be granted protection as a conscientious objector due to his refusal to serve in the Turkish military because of their alleged involvement in human rights abuses and war crimes. The Federal Court ultimately dismissed his application for judicial review of the Immigration and Refugee Board's decision that he was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.The Canadian Refugee Board rejected an application for asylum from a Turkish man who claimed that he would be persecuted if he returned to Turkey due to his refusal to serve in the military on conscientious grounds. The Board ruled that the applicant didn't show enough evidence of his beliefs and failed to take proactive steps to avoid military service and that the punishments for refusing military conscription in Turkey were not severe enough to amount to persecution.
