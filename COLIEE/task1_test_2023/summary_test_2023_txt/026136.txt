The applicant a sailor from China sought a judicial review to overturn the decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division that he was not a Convention refugee. The tribunal had accepted the applicant's testimony as trustworthy but concluded that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of his political opinion. The court found that the tribunal erred in misstating the test for a Convention refugee identifying the principal issue incorrectly and neglecting to assess the basis of the applicant's claim. The matter was referred back for reconsideration by a newly constituted panel.
