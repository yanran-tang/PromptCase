Action Express Ltd. challenged the decision of Adjudicator Dan R. Cameron to award seven months pay in lieu of notice to Shelly Lesy following her unjust dismissal complaint. Lesy sought a salary increase which was not granted and subsequently wrote a letter to the company expressing her frustration. The Applicant argues that the Adjudicator's decision was unreasonable and seeks a referral of the matter to a new adjudicator.The letter from employee Shelly Lesy expresses frustration with her job and asks for a response about potential changes or she'll consider leaving. After receiving a positive review from her employer Mr. Lincoln she sends a second letter demanding unpaid wages and interest and threatening legal action. Mr. Lincoln sees this as an attack on management and resigns her.An employee appealed her termination from Action Express Ltd. under the Canada Labour Code. The decision was made to terminate the employee immediately for cause and the Adjudicator was tasked with determining if the termination was just. The Adjudicator found that the employee did not resign and was terminated for cause due to insubordination namely sending disrespectful letters to management and refusing to provide a letter of apology. The Adjudicator concluded that the termination was appropriate.
