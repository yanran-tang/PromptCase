The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is trying to strike an application by TELUS seeking to prevent the CRA from assessing the company for goods and services tax on international roaming fees charged by the companyâ€™s customers from October 2004. The CRA is also appealing a 2009 order allowing TELUS access to certain documents. TELUS argues that the CRA used irrelevant factors and made erroneous assumptions in exercising its discretionary power to reassess taxes. The company filed its original notice of application in 2009.The Court of Appeals denied TELUS' motion to strike a judicial review application by the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) regarding a tax assessment. The CRA requested TELUS employee Maureen Trattner to answer additional questions on cross-examination which TELUS opposed. The court found that the timing of the motion to strike was irrelevant and rejected TELUS' argument that the CRA had not followed proper procedure. The court ordered the CRA to provide further written answers and documents as requested.The Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) seeks to bring a motion for dismissal of TELUS Communications Inc.'s judicial review of the CRA's decision not to reassess TELUS for the period of 2005-2010. TELUS argues that the motion should not have been brought this early in the proceedings and that the Minister has discretion in assessing and reassessing taxpayers. There is a disagreement between the parties as to whether the obligations of the Minister under the Excise Tax Act (ETA) are mandatory or discretionary. The provisions of the ETA that are relevant to the motions before the Court set out a regime with respect to GST.
