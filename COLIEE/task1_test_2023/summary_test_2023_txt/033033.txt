Michel Desloges a former employee of Foreign Affairs Canada filed a grievance claiming that he was not given acting pay for performing the duties of a higher level position. The Assistant Deputy Minister dismissed the grievance citing that it was not filed within the required time frame and that it was not the department's practice to give acting pay to rotational executives. Desloges took the matter to court for a judicial review.The Assistant Deputy Minister decided that an employee did not receive acting pay because the Deputy Head of the Department had elected not to implement a policy for employees in rotational executive positions. This decision was made under Part 5.3 of the Salary Policy which allows for exemptions in certain situations. The relevant provisions of the Public Services Staff Relations Act define an employee as someone who is not in a managerial or confidential position. The regulations state that the final decision on a grievance is binding and cannot be further appealed.
