The case involves an Iranian citizen's application for permanent residency in Canada under the independent category. The visa officer refused the application citing insufficient funds and a lack of preparedness initiative and motivation for immigration. The applicant challenged the decision arguing that the visa officer fettered her discretion in using the Low Income Cut-Off table and breached the duty of fairness by not advising her of her concerns. The court allowed the application and remitted the matter for reconsideration by a different visa officer.
