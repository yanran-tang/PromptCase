Mrs. Goodluck seeks judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division that found her children were Convention refugees but did not grant her refugee status or protection. She claimed to have experienced abuse from her husband in Guyana and feared persecution in Ukraine and Guyana. The Board found that the domestic violence legislation in Guyana would provide the applicant with protection but not her children. The Federal Court set aside the decision and remitted the case to the Board for redetermination.
