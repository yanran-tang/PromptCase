An Immigration Officer denied Virginia Mihura Torres' application for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class due to the Applicant providing only one letter of reference from previous employers which lacked details about her duties. Torres had applied in 2007 and provided the required information about her work history and experience. However in 2010 her application was denied and she applied for judicial review of the decision.The Applicant received a letter from the Canadian embassy in Caracas requesting job reference letters/confirmation of employment letters and a detailed description of job responsibilities in order to meet selection and admissibility requirements. The Applicant's counsel received an exemption from translating Spanish documents for her many Venezuela clients. The Applicant submitted forms and untranslated documents in support of her application but was later refused due to lack of information on her job duties. The Applicant argues that the Immigration Officer erred in law and violated principles of procedural fairness.
