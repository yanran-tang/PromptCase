rown appealed a judgment in favor of Mattabi Mines alleging that the company had wrongly deducted inventory allowances on its tax returns for the 1977 and 1978 taxation years. The case involved the complex process of mining and processing zinc copper lead and silver ore and converting it into concentrate for sale. The defendant's witness Bruce Park Wallace a mineral processing engineer provided detailed testimony on the processes involved.The process of obtaining copper lead and zinc concentrates from ore rock is described in detail. The concentrates are sent for smelting and refining to produce copper metal gold silver and cathode copper. The waste product known as tailings is stored indefinitely. The flotation process is identified as a crucial step in the process of obtaining concentrate and reagents are used to make it effective. Differential flotation is also used to concentrate similar minerals from the same ore.Flotation reagents chemical compounds necessary for mining are used in small quantities to cause minerals to float to the surface and be skimmed off for processing. The correct amount of reagent must be added to achieve desired results with different reagents used for different minerals in varying quantities. The reagents have a short lifespan and can decompose quickly due to temperature and oxygen. Mattabi must store a significant inventory of the reagents on hand to avoid plant closure. A test performed by Mattabi showed the presence of residual reagents in ore concentrate.Technitrol Canada Ltd. tested three samples of zinc concentrate from the defendant's mill which contained small quantities of reagents. The reagents are an essential additive for production and the end product the concentrate contains a very small quantity of reagent that has no value or effect on the concentrate's value. Noranda Inc. now owns 60% of Mattabi and the first marketable product of the defendant is the concentrate.
