The case involves an Indian citizen from the state of Punjab who claimed refugee protection in Canada due to being persecuted on the basis of his membership in a particular social group and political opinion. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board determined that state protection was available to the applicant in India and that he should have alerted the Indian authorities to his situation before claiming refugee protection in Canada. The court rejected the application for judicial review finding that the decision was justified and defensible based on the facts and law.
