This case is an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) to dismiss the appeal of a Removal Order against Ahmet Ekici a 26-year-old permanent resident of Canada originally from Turkey. The IAD found that Ekici did not disclose the existence of his common-law spouse and dependent son and therefore was inadmissible for misrepresentation. The court found that the IAD's decision was reasonable and not open to review.
