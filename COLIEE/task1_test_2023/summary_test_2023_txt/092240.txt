The case involves an application for a refugee claim by a family from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected their claim and concluded they were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The court reviewed whether the RPD erred in failing to provide a separate analysis under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The court found that a negative credibility finding in relation to section 96 will often obviate the need to consider section 97 and therefore dismissed the application for judicial review.
