Ms. Maria Isabel Ribeiro Da Costa Soares a citizen of Portugal applied for refugee status in Canada based on claims of domestic violence from her former spouse. However the Refugee Protection Division found that her late claim lacked subjective fear and that adequate state protection was available in Portugal. The Court found no basis to intervene upholding the Board's decision.The Board did not find the applicant qualified as a refugee and determined that her removal to Portugal would not subject her to risk of persecution or harm. The case raises issues related to the rejection of untranslated documents the finding on state protection the application of gender-related persecution guidelines and a potential negative inference regarding the applicant's fear of persecution. The relevant legal provisions are sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.
