A veteran of the Canadian military has applied for a judicial review of a decision by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board which had refused to reconsider an earlier decision denying his disability pension. The applicant claims that his 1958 army truck accident in Germany caused his subsequent neck pain which was denied as age-related by the Pension Commission and the Entitlement Board. Despite a medical report from an orthopaedic surgeon the Veterans Appeal Board refused to overturn the earlier decisions. The applicant seeks an order to set aside the VRAB's decision and refer the matter back for reconsideration.The case involves a war veteran seeking compensation for injuries sustained in a 1958 motor vehicle accident. Despite the opinions of three medical professionals the Veterans Review and Appeal Board (VAB) and its successor the Veterans Review and Appeal Board (VRAB) have refused to reconsider their decision denying the veteran's claim. The case raises questions about the fairness of the appeal and review process for veterans' pensions.The Veterans Appeal Board is not persuaded by evidence provided by Dr. F.T. Murdoch for reconsideration of a decision made earlier. The applicant argues the VRAB made several jurisdictional and procedural errors but the respondent argues the VRAB made no errors and considered the evidence to be speculative. The analysis focuses on the nature of reconsideration and the interpretation of new evidence under the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act.
