A family from Bogota Colombia who fled to Canada seeking protection after receiving threatening phone calls from a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) had their claim for refugee status rejected by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. The familyâ€™s case was later dismissed upon judicial review in 2011 with the court stating that the Board made some errors and unreasonable findings but ultimately failed to establish that the Board erred in finding that the family had not rebutted the presumption of state protection.
