Canada's Attorney General has brought applications for a writ and an order of certiorari against the Canadian Human Rights Commission to suppress their investigation into a complaint of repeated racial and sexual discrimination made by Mary Pitawanakwat a woman of Ojibway ancestry against her former employer the federal Department of the Secretary of State after she was recommended for release due to incompetence. The case began over a decade ago and continues to be disputed by both sides.This legal case involves a complaint of racial discrimination in the workplace filed by an employee against her employer. The employer responded with a recommendation to dismiss the employee who then appealed the decision under section 31 of the Public Service Employment Act. While the appeal was ongoing the Canadian Human Rights Act complaint was temporarily postponed. Evidence presented at the appeal hearing included multiple allegations of racial discrimination which were ultimately deemed not justified by the Public Service Commission Appeal Board.The P.S.C.A.B upheld a recommendation to release a complainant from her employment for incompetence but the complainant claimed she had been the victim of discrimination. The written decision noted that the complainant had countered the allegation of incompetence with her own allegation of racial discrimination. The chairman mentioned alleged racist incidents and counter allegations of discrimination but trivialized the complainant's contentions.The P.S.C.A.B. decision addressed both the issue of incompetence and the issue of racial discrimination but focused heavily on the former instead of giving equal weight to both. While incompetence and discrimination can be linked in terms of logic they are different in sequence and quality. Racial prejudice can be ingrained from a young age and can affect one's perception of competence or incompetence.The case involves a complaint of racial discrimination and incompetence against an employer. The Public Service Commission of Canada which adjudicated the case did not give much importance to the complainant's counter-allegations of racial discrimination. The Canadian Human Rights Act intervened and the Federal Court ordered the Commission to proceed with the complaint emphasizing that the Commission cannot dispose of a complaintÂ just because another inquiry had already rendered its decision.
