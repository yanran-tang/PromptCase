e the court is whether the Immigration Appeals Division (IAD) erred in affirming a visa officer's decision that the applicant's illegitimate daughter was not a member of the family class as the applicant had not disclosed her existence at the time of processing his application or landing in Canada. The applicant argues that paragraph 117(9)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations is overbroad and contrary to the rule of law. The court finds in favor of the applicant on the first issue and does not address the constitutional question.Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) ruled that an applicant was precluded from sponsoring his daughter as a member of the family class since he failed to disclose her existence at the time of his application for permanent residence in Canada. The IAD considered evidence such as a baptismal certificate photographs and financial statements indicating that the applicant had supported his daughter. Additionally the IAD found the applicant's claim that he was not aware of his daughter's existence until after his arrival in Canada stretched the bounds of credulity. The applicable legislation restricts an applicant from sponsoring a non-accompanying family member who was not examined at the time of the sponsor's application for permanent residence.
