The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Review Tribunal-Canada Pension Plan/Old Age Security ordering the Minister to make an ex gratia payment to the applicant. The issue at hand is whether the Review Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in making such an order. The relevant provisions of the Old Age Security Act and the Canada Pension Plan are cited and it is concluded that an ex gratia payment is not covered by the provisions of either act. The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is sent back to the Review Tribunal for reconsideration.
