The Fisheries Council of British Columbia seeks to intervene in a proceeding where the Yale Indian Band challenges the right of the Minister of Fisheries to issue a communal salmon fishing license to the Yale Band and 24 Lower Fraser River Indian Bands. The dispute is private with the Yale Band claiming it wants to fish in its traditional territory. The Fisheries Council seeks to justify its interest in the matter but it is not clear what unique insights they can bring to the issue.The Fisheries Council's application for intervention in a case involving the Yale First Nation's aboriginal right and title to a salmon fishery in the Fraser River has been dismissed. The Lower Fraser Bands contest the Yale Band's right and title to the fishery in a particular reach of the river claiming a joint tenure. The Yale Band seeks a review of the issuance of a communal fishing licence for May 1998 requesting a prohibition against the Minister of Fisheries from preventing communal fishing licences for the Strawberry Island to Sawmill Creek area for the Lower Fraser Bands.
