This is a case of judicial review of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner's decision to confirm disciplinary action against an officer for disclosing confidential documents to a non-member of the RCMP without authorization. The officer argues bias the 'whistle-blowing' defense breaches of natural justice and that the disciplinary action was an abuse of process. The agreed facts show that the officer released nine documents to a Canadian author between January 1998 and October 1999. The officer had a successful career before the incident including undercover operations and working on organized crime investigations.An RCMP officer drafted confidential briefing notes suggesting flaws in current models of policing outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMGs) and proposed improvements but allegedly released them out of frustration with the RCMP's inadequate investigations into the Hells Angels motorcycle gang. The officer claims he released the documents to corroborate his assertions regarding the policing of OMGs after considering his legal moral and ethical obligations to his employer. He apologized when the documents were published in a book but faced disciplinary action and a hearing for disgraceful conduct that could bring discredit on the force ultimately resulting in dismissal.An RCMP officer was directed to resign after being found guilty of discreditable conduct in April 2001 following hearings held over a 10-day period. The officer released documents that were embarrassing to individuals without sufficiently vetting them and showed little remorse for his actions. The External Review Committee's decision on appeal in June 2002 concurred that the officer violated his duty of loyalty and brought discredit to the RCMP.The applicant was dismissed from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) due to a breach of his duty of loyalty towards his employer. The RCMP had legitimate concerns that the applicant could no longer be trusted with confidential information and the sanction of dismissal was appropriate in such circumstances. The relevant legislation includes the RCMP Act RCMP Regulations and Federal Courts Act. The standard of review is determined by considering four contextual factors including the presence or absence of a privative clause or statutory right of appeal. The RCMP Act contains a partial privative clause meaning deference is owed to the Commissioner's decision.The amount of deference given to the Commissioner in the RCMP's disciplinary process is determined by expertise purpose of legislation and the nature of the question. Questions of fact are given great deference questions of law are reviewed without deference and mixed law and fact questions are reviewed with limited deference. The applicant raises issues regarding bias procedural fairness abuse of process and the law of whistle-blowing. The RCMP Act provides a comprehensive and fair process for disciplinary action against members of the RCMP with three stages of checks and balances and judicial review by the Federal Court.
