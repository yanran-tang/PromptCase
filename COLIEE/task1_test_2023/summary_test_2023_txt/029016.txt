The case involves the Merck patent which covers claims for the invention of certain compounds used for treating hypertension and congestive heart failure. Merck is seeking to strike out a paragraph in Apotex's defense which claims that the Merck patent is invalid. Merck argues that the issue of patent invalidity has already been conclusively determined by the courts. Apotex had previously sought a declaration that certain claims in the Merck patent were invalid.This passage describes a legal case between pharmaceutical companies Merck and Apotex over patent infringement related to the drug enalapril. The court initially ruled in favor of Merck finding that Apotex infringed on the patent and could not sell their version of the drug. Apotex appealed and the Federal Court of Appeal overturned the original ruling except for three lots of the drug that had been re-processed after the patent had been issued. The court found that Apotex could use and sell enalapril acquired before the issuance of the patent under section 56 of the Canadian Patent Act.The Federal Court of Appeal considered the issue of a further lot of enalapril maleate acquired by Apotex after the patent was issued and held that Apotex had no right to produce tablets for use as an anti-hypertensive from the purchased bulk enalapril maleate. The court also dealt with Apotex's attack on Merck's patent including questions of novelty inventiveness ambiguity insufficiency and redundancy concluding that Apotex's counterclaim failed.
