4 taxation years the defendant Minister of National Revenue restricted the deduction of the plaintiffâ€™s farm losses pursuant to s. 31(1) of the Income Tax Act. The plaintiff an orthopaedic surgeon had established a vineyard due to ongoing health issues and sought assurance from a Department of Revenue official that start-up costs were deductible. The official claimed not to remember such a conversation. The case involved several days of testimony and expert witnesses.The taxpayer invested over $300000 in developing his vineyard between 1982 and 1985 with an estimated investment of $650000 by 1992. The vineyard was developed gradually due to limited income from the taxpayer's medical practice. By 1992 the vineyard was estimated to be one quarter in full production and was expected to generate a reasonable profit in the future. Expert witnesses testified about the vineyard's future expectation of profit with Colio Wines of Canada purchasing grapes from the vineyard every year since 1987.The plaintiff and his wife established a vineyard and made necessary investments to make it profitable. An accounting firm provided income and cash flow projections for the vineyard with revised projections predicting profitability by 1991. The plaintiff's time commitment to his medical practice reduced after an operation allowing more time for the vineyard and he took courses in grape growing and wine making. Despite spending less time on his medical practice his income did not decrease due to performing more lucrative procedures and a rise in OHIP billing.
