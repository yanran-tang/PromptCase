The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration appeals a decision dated July 10 2001 in which the respondent is found to have met the requirements for Canadian citizenship. The appeal concerns the finding by a Citizenship Judge that the respondent had met the requirements for residence conditions. The Citizenship Judge failed to assess the respondent's own connection with Canada and did not determine when he established residence. The decision is set aside and the respondent's application for Canadian citizenship is referred to the Citizenship Court for reconsideration.
