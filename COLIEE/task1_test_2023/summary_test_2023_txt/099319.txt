Robin Roberts sought an injunction to prevent the Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation and the Ginew Housing Authority Incorporated from evicting her and her family from Housing Unit B-96 situated in Manitoba. However the court found that she had not demonstrated that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were not granted and that the balance of convenience favoured the respondents. As a result the motion was dismissed and Roberts was ordered to vacate the housing unit by 5:00 p.m. on April 15 2010.
