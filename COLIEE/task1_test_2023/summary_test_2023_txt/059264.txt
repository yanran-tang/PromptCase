The case concerns an application for refugee protection by a couple from Guyana who claim they were persecuted by members of the Afro-Guyanese community due to their Indian ethnicity. The Immigration and Refugee Board rejected their application but the Federal Court found that while it was not convinced that the rejection was unreasonable the Board did not adequately address the whole of their application or provide adequate reasons for its decision. The case was therefore allowed and the matter was remitted for reconsideration.
