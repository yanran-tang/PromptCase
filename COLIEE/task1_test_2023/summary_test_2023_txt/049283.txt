The Male and Female Applicants came to Canada in 1988 and made a refugee claim which was rejected. They were granted an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in 1994 but their application for landing was rejected in 2000. The Male Applicant was later found to be inadmissible due to a criminal conviction and the Applicants applied for a pre-removal risk assessment which was rejected due to insufficient evidence. The Applicants filed a new application for consideration on humanitarian and compassionate grounds which is still pending.The officer concluded that the female applicant's health issues including complete kidney failure requiring dialysis did not fall under their mandate to consider as there were medical facilities in India to deal with dialysis. The officer also stated that they did not have the jurisdiction to consider Charter arguments and that relevant provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Regulations should not be ignored.
