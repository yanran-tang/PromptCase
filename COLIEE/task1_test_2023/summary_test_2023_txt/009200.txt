A former member of the Canadian Armed Forces is seeking judicial review challenging the decision to release him from service. The applicant had a history of behavioural difficulties and alcohol misuse leading to a recommendation for his release from the military. He sought various orders including reinstatement with pay and benefits from the date of his release and an order for costs on a solicitor-client basis. The applicant was apparently unsuccessful in obtaining all the information regarding his release despite seeking assistance from an Assisting Officer.In 1993 an officer in the Canadian military was dismissed but later challenged the decision in court. A second review board was established but the officer was not allowed to attend or be represented. The board recommended the officer's release due to alcohol abuse. The officer was not given an opportunity to address the Director General and the court later considered whether the internal grievance process was completed.
