Jody Kathryn Leigh Kuntz challenged the decision of the Director of Cadet Training at Depot Division to terminate her Cadet Training Agreement claiming wrongful termination and breach of duty of fairness. However the Supreme Court of Canada held that even if there was a breach of natural justice the remedy should not be granted if the result of the case would be the same. Ms. Kuntz was a 31-year-old mother of two who had previously worked as both a Deputy Sheriff and a bank employee before enrolling in the RCMP training program in January 2005.In a case involving former Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) cadet Bria Kuntz it was determined that the RCMP was within its rights to terminate Kuntz's training after she engaged in behavior deemed inappropriate including sexual comments and physical contact with other cadets. Kuntz had signed an agreement prior to her training which stipulated that her engagement was not guaranteed and could be revoked at any time.
