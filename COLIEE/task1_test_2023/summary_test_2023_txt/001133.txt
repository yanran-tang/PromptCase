The case involves a homosexual Mexican citizen who fled to Canada with his family after he raised concerns about a group he joined that promoted anti-gay sentiment and was subsequently threatened and attacked. The family's application for refugee status in Canada was rejected by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The decision was based on the Board's assessment of the level of protection offered by the Mexican state to sexual minorities which the Board did not find to be inadequate.g to the Board the Principal Applicant had knowledge of various state agencies and organizations that could have assisted him with his situation as a homosexual being threatened and discriminated against. However he did not seek their assistance citing their alleged corruption or lack of explicit support for homosexuality. The Board ultimately concluded that his failure to seek state protection in Mexico rendered his claim for international protection unfounded.
