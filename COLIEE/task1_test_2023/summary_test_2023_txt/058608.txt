The defendants in a lawsuit brought by Coca-Cola Ltd. and Coca-Cola Bottling Ltd. for trademark infringement have requested four forms of relief but the court rules only their motion to strike certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is appropriate under rule 419 of the Federal Court Rules. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants infringed on their trademarks and devalued their goodwill. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs' two primary claims cannot stand and that their export of Coca-Cola products purchased in Canada is not an unauthorized use of the plaintiffs' trademarks according to the Trade-marks Act.The plaintiffs believe that the defendants violated their licensing agreement by purchasing and reselling Coca-Cola products abroad which is beyond the jurisdiction of the court. However the defendants argue that they have the right to export trademarked goods and were aware of the limitations set by the plaintiffs. While there are exceptions to the general principle of striking pleadings the court finds no delay in the defendants' motion to strike in this case.
