Mr. Liang claimed refugee status in Canada but was found to be inadmissible as a person with criminal ties. He faced charges in China for conspiracy to commit murder and leading organized crime which he claimed were false. The former Convention Refugee Determination Division concluded that Mr. Liang had committed a serious non-political crime and excluded him from receiving refugee status.The court found that the evidence presented by the applicant's expert witness concerning Chinese documents should be given little weight as he was not an expert in Chinese ideograms. The standard of review for findings of fact made by the CRDD is patent unreasonableness. The standard of proof required for exclusion should not be higher than the reasonable grounds standard set out in previous cases.Mr. Liang argues that the Minister's burden in relation to exclusion should be higher than the less than a balance of probabilities standard. He also argues that the standard of proof should be higher when considering the interrelationship between the standard of proof on exclusion and inclusion. The court disagrees and cites the Ramirez case which found that serious grounds for considering was a lower standard of proof than the civil standard. Furthermore there is no evidence to support Mr. Liang's claim that he is eligible for inclusion as a refugee.
