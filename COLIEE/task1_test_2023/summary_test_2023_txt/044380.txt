This case concerns an application for judicial review of an adjudicator's decision by the Public Service Labour Relations Board. The applicant Ms. Charlotte Rh√©aume is an employee of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. The case revolves around the transfer of administration of the Goods and Services Tax from the Canadian government to the Quebec government and the subsequent transfer of federal employees involved in its administration.The case involves an employee in Canada who filed a grievance seeking to be treated fairly and equitably in comparison to her colleagues in other provinces. She argued that she was doing the same work as them but was being paid less. The grievance was dismissed by the adjudicator as he found the evidence inconclusive. The issues in this application are to determine the standard of review that should be applied to the adjudicator's decision and whether it meets the appropriate standard of review.
