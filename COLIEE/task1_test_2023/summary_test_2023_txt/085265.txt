This case involves an application for judicial review of an unfavourable decision by the Immigration Division regarding the admissibility of the applicant based on serious criminality. The applicant who claimed refugee status in Canada was accused of falsely representing himself as a US citizen in a loan application and faced charges in the US which were equivalent to an indictable offence of fraud under the Criminal Code in Canada. The Tribunal's decision was upheld as it did not err in law or fact in assessing the offence and identifying its Canadian equivalent.applicant's admissibility to Canada based on their criminality. The Tribunal reviewed the applicant's testimony and evidence of his criminal charges and concluded that he was not credible in his explanations for his actions. They found that he had intended to obtain money fraudulently and acted contrary to US and Canadian laws. As a result the Tribunal deemed him inadmissible to Canada on grounds of serious criminality.
