Ms. Adrianne McNabb seeks judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision dismissing her complaint of discrimination against her employer Canada Post Corporation. The Applicant alleges failure to accommodate in employment specifically regarding her disability limitations. Her transfer requests to other locations were allegedly denied based on her restrictions. The Applicant was eventually allowed to transfer to Courtenay but alleges that her employer failed to accommodate her once she began working there.The Applicant claimed that the Respondent violated the collective agreement and the Act by refusing to accommodate her disability which led to her being sent home on sick leave and being given different job duties. She also alleged that the union refused to grieve on her behalf and that there was a policy to refuse transfers due to disability. The Respondent argued that the complaint's time limits had expired and that the grievance procedures should be pursued instead.An investigation into a complaint of discrimination was conducted between November 2004 and January 2005 and the Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the allegation was unsupported by evidence. The Applicant claimed discrimination on prohibited grounds of race national or ethnic origin colour religion age sex sexual orientation marital status family status disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted. The Commission only considered allegations that occurred after November 2002 for timeliness reasons.
