arized as the judicial review of a negative decision on a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) for a 70-year-old Sri Lankan citizen who had made multiple unsuccessful attempts for refugee protection.

The relevant provisions are Section 96 for Convention refugees and Section 97 for persons in need of protection. The Applicant is seeking to present new evidence following the rejection of their claim for protection.
