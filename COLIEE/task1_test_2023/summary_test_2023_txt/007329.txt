The case concerns an immigration appeal in which the applicant was found to have misrepresented material facts relating to his permanent residence application by failing to disclose that he had a son. The Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board ultimately upheld the removal order finding that the applicant had not met the burden of showing that he should not be removed from Canada. The court found that the IAD had not committed any reviewable error and dismissed the application for judicial review.
