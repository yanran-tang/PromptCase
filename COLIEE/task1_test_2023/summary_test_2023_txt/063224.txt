The case concerns whether the contents of a letter from the Assistant Commissioner of a government agency are subject to judicial review. In 2001 the applicant was deemed unqualified for a position as a Collections Officer. In 2002 he attempted to reopen the decision resulting in a letter from the Assistant Commissioner stating that there was no further recourse available. The Court found that the letter was merely a courtesy and not a decision subject to judicial review. The application was dismissed and costs were awarded to the respondent.
