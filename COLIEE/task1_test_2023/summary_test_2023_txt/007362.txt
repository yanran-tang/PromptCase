This case involves a judicial review of a decision made by the Convention Refugee Determination Division that allowed the Minister's application to vacate the applicants' Convention refugee status on the ground of fraudulent concealment of a material fact. The applicants entered Canada in 1989 claiming Somalian identification papers but were later found to have used Djiboutian passports under different names. The Minister made three unsuccessful applications to vacate their refugee status before succeeding in 1996.In a 1996 judicial review the Canadian Refugee Division vacated the refugee status of two applicants from Somalia who were found to have concealed their Djiboutian citizenship. The applicants argued that the decision was erroneous on the basis of res judicata but the court rejected this argument clarifying the requirements for issue estoppel. The decision was based on new evidence including forensic test results and testimony from the ex-American Consul to Djibouti.
