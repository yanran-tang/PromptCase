The case of Alissa Khon versus the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration involved a young woman who claimed refugee status in Canada due to violence suffered from her former male partner in Kazakhstan. The Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) rejected her claim but the federal court ordered a differently constituted panel to review the case citing errors in disregarding the necessary steps to obtain protection from authorities and an internal flight alternative as well as failing to examine the claim following the Guidelines of the Chairperson of the IRB.
