The standard of review is reasonableness and the decision is deemed reasonable due to the discretion afforded in the authorization of private family visits by the Corrections and Conditional Release Act Commissioner's Directive 770 and Standard Operating Practice 700-12. The goal of the correctional system is to assist in the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders into the community while protecting society and eligibility for private family visits is based on factors including the risk of family violence.
