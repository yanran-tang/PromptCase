The case involves a dispute over whether the plaintiff is entitled to deduct an inventory allowance and carry back a noncapital loss to its 1976 taxation year. The plaintiff conceded it was not entitled to a deduction for nonfinished goods inventory but seeks to have the matter referred back for reconsideration of finished goods inventory. The case involves a complex corporate restructuring involving the incorporation of a new company and the transfer of assets and properties.This case involves an Asset Transfer Agreement between GSW and Camco where GSW agreed to sell its Major Appliance Operations to Camco. The transfer was to take effect on January 1 1977 with the closing on January 4 1977. Prior to the closing GSW transferred all the assets of one of its subsidiaries including inventories to itself in an Indenture. The question before the court was whether such transfers were in breach of the Asset Transfer Agreement.
