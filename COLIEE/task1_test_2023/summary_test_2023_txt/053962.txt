The applicant's request for judicial review of a decision that she is not a Convention refugee within the Immigration Act has been dismissed despite concerns over the assessment of refugee claims concerning fear of persecution based on gender. The tribunal's conclusion that the applicant could expect protection from authorities in Grenada was not deemed unreasonable. However the tribunal was found to have erred in its assessment of whether the applicant's claim met the definition of a particular social group and by failing to explicitly refer to Guidelines in relation to the applicant's claim.
