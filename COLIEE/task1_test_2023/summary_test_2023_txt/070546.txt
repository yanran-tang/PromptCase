A municipal policeman and his wife fled Mexico claiming they feared a drug lord whom the officer had arrested but whom a judge had released. The immigration and refugee board rejected their refugee application on the basis of an absence of a nexus to a Convention ground and found that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption of state protection in Mexico. The court dismissed their judicial review finding that the board's conclusion on the issue of state protection was reasonable.
