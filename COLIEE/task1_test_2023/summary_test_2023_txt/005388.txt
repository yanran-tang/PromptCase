This case involves an appeal against a decision by the Registrar of Trademarks who refused to expunge or amend Imperial Tobacco's trademark for its cigarettes called Cambridge. The appellant Philip Morris Incorporated had sought to challenge the continued use of the trademark. However the Registrar concluded that Imperial Tobacco had provided evidence of continuous use of the trademark and denied Philip Morris' request.The case concerns the use of the trademark CAMBRIDGE in Canada. The court found that the trademark was in use in the normal course of trade in Canada as of the date of the section 44 notice. The appellant filed an appeal but the Registrar did not contest it. Further evidence was provided by two affidavits which supported the use of CAMBRIDGE cigarettes in retail outlets.
