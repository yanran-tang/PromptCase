A man facing removal to Scotland has been granted a stay on the execution pending determination by the Canadian authorities of his application for landing on humanitarian and compassionate grounds made in 1999. The applicant has been in Canada since the age of three and is married to a Canadian citizen with a Canadian-born daughter. The applicant has no status in Canada having been convicted of assault robbery and obstruction of justice but there is a serious question as to whether he can be deported while awaiting a decision on his application.
