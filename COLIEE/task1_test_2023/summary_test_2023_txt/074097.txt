The plaintiff brought an application under Rule 465 to prevent the defendant from having their chosen representative present at the discovery of the plaintiff's representative. The court dismissed the motion stating that it is important for a party's representative to be present during examinations for discovery in order to explore fully the issues raised by the pleadings and to gain admissions from the examinee. The court also noted that concerns over witnesses tailoring their evidence in the presence of the opposite party's representative were overemphasized.
