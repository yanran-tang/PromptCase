This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Canada in which the Board denied the applicant's claim for disability pension benefits for cervical disc disease. The applicant a retired RCMP officer claimed that his cervical disc disease was caused by asymptomatic microtrauma during his 28 years of service. The Board did not accept this claim due to a lack of documented clinical evidence and the absence of supporting expert opinions and epidemiological studies. The court finds that the Board's decision was reasonable and dismisses the application.
