The case concerns a 17-year-old boy from Iraq who arrived in Canada seeking refuge from violent tribal revenge against his family in Iraq. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board concluded the boy was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection based on negative credibility findings. The Court found that the Board made erroneous findings of fact respecting credibility and erred in failing to provide sufficient reasons to address whether the applicant faced an objective risk of persecution if returned to Iraq. The Court remitted the refugee claim back to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.
