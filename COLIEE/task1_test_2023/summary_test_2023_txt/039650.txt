Revenue Canada Taxation incorporates these changes into the tax return which consists of a four-page tax jacket and accompanying schedules/forms. Chief of the Individual Assessing Section of Revenue Canada Taxation Bruce Muir was responsible for developing the T1 General income tax return starting in 1987. Due to the significant overhaul proofs of the new form were not available until November 1988. Universal & Robina Corporation (U&R) sought to gain a competitive advantage by teaching the 1988 tax changes on a 1988 T1 General return thereby enhancing its reputation as an industry leader and attracting more students and employees.Due to substantial changes in the Income Tax Act the government was going to be late in releasing its T1 General return so the U&R decided to fund the development of its own draft form. Using the government's 1987 T1 General draft form as a starting point Evelyn Jacks and Shirley Smith created the U&R 1988 T1 General Draft Form through conversations with government officials and a background knowledge in tax. Bruce Muir confirmed that the U&R form was on the right track and made minimal changes to the line code numbers on U&R's draft form. The U&R 1988 T1 General Draft Form was completed on or before July 18 1988 and the plaintiff is the registered owner of copyright in the work.
