The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision made by Senior Immigration Officer Kathleen Galloway which denied his right to leave Canada to a country of his choice. The decision was based on the fact that the applicant was determined to be a danger to the public in Canada due to his criminal convictions. The applicant is a citizen of Iran who was landed in Canada as a Convention refugee in 1990.In 1993 and 1994 the applicant was convicted of several crimes including theft and drug-related offenses. In September 1994 he was reported for inquiry under the Immigration Act due to his convictions. In May 1996 a delegate of the Minister issued opinions that the applicant constituted a danger to the public in Canada considering the possibility of risk to him in returning to his country of origin Iran. His solicitors submitted reports on the human rights situation in Iran to support his case.Mr. Moktari was facing deportation from Canada to Iran where he believed he would be executed or tortured due to his alleged involvement in anti-government activities and desertion from the military. His lawyers argued that his deportation would put his family in Iran in danger and a risk assessment concluded that he faced significant risk if returned. They called on the Minister to exercise compassion and not invoke section 70(5) in his case.Mr. Moktari was convicted of selling large amounts of cocaine to police undercover agents and was ordered to be deported from Canada in 1996. He had concerns about being returned to Iran due to having defected from the military during a time of war and believed the government did not know he was alive. Mr. Moktari also had prior criminal convictions and was arrested again while out on parole.
