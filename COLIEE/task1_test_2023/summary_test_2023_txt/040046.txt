Citizen of Guyana born October 17 1978 Safraz Vickram fears for his life and claims he was beaten threatened and harassed by bandits. Vickram's claim for refugee protection was rejected by Immigration and Refugee Board's Refugee Protection Division. The Board concluded that the acts of violence perpetrated against Vickram were criminal acts with no link to his ethnicity and therefore rejected his claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
