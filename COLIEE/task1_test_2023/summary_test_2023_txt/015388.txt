that the Applicant's testimony was not credible and that his claim relied solely on speculation and conjecture. They found that the threats he received were not specific or credible and that the police had provided some protection despite his claims to the contrary. The Court will review this decision under subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.The applicant was found to not be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection by the RPD because he had not established a nexus to a Convention ground and the risk he faced was a generalized rather than a personalized risk. The RPD found that the FARC was extorting the applicant for monetary gain and furthering their criminal interests and the threats he received were not particularized to him. The applicant failed to provide sufficient reliable and probative evidence to support his claim.The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the claim of an applicant and his family who were extorted and threatened by FARC a Colombian guerrilla group. Although the applicant was specifically targeted the RPD concluded that he faced a generalized risk of violence that many people in the country face and that the risk of violence from criminal organizations is faced by all Colombians. The RPD did not consider the Applicant a Convention refugee and therefore the claim was rejected.
