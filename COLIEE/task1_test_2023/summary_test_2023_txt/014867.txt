The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada denying the applicant's appeal against a removal order. The applicant a Sri Lankan citizen had accumulated criminal convictions and had no ties in Sri Lanka but the IAD concluded that his removal would not cause undue hardship. The Federal Court of Canada found that the IAD's analysis on this point was inadequate and its decision was therefore set aside.
