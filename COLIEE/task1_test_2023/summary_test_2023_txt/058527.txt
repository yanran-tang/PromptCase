The case involves Pfizer Canada Inc. seeking an injunction to prevent the issuance of notices of compliance to Apotex for fluconazole tablets and capsules until the expiry of Pfizer's patent. Apotex argues their manufacturing process is non-infringing and a confidentiality order was obtained. However Apotex did not produce the requested documents related to their process in court leading to Pfizer's application for an injunction. The case involves the regulatory scheme established under the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations.Pfizer accused Apotex of not producing the necessary documents related to the manufacturing process of fluconazole. Although Apotex argued that the process was not required to be part of the New Drug Submission Pfizer argued that it was necessary for them to know the process. Dr. Sherman testified that the process was not submitted because it was a cross-reference submission which did not require details of the manufacturing process.Pfizer brought a motion seeking the production of documents related to the process Apotex submitted in its New Drug Submission. The motion was withdrawn without prejudice but Pfizer argued that Apotex's evidence should be struck from the record due to the lack of production. However the judge rejected this argument noting that Pfizer had withdrawn the motion.The court has ruled that Apotex's failure to produce documents that do not exist cannot be seen as a breach of Mr. Justice NoÃ«l's order. Pfizer argued that the non-disclosure of documentation renders Apotex's Notice of Allegation unjustified but the court found this argument unpersuasive. The process that will be used has been disclosed and the cross-referenced submission will be subject to the regulatory scheme established in the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations. Pfizer may still raise other issues at a higher level.
