The applicant is seeking to overturn the decision made by an Adjudicator who ruled that their employer had made every reasonable effort to grant their leave request for a specific date. The dispute arose after a leave request for September 2 1993 was denied by the employer citing specific company policy. The collective agreement between the Canadian Air Traffic Control Association and the respondent governs the terms and conditions of employment for the applicant. The court determined that the Adjudicator's decision was supported by the evidence and the application was dismissed.
