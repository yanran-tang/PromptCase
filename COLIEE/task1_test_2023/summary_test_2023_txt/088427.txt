This case concerns an application for judicial review over the Registrar of Trade-marks' decision to publish notice of adoption and use of the mark ICEWINE by Vintners Quality Alliance of Canada (VQA) pursuant to the Trade-marks Act. The focus of the application concerns the mark ICEWINE but will also apply to other marks published by the Registrar. The hearing was set down for January 2001 with other similar applications from wine producers but VQA withdrew publication of all the official marks in question just before the hearing at the request of the federal government.The Magnotta group of companies filed an application for judicial review seeking to set aside the Registrar's decision to give notice of adoption and use of the mark ICEWINE by VQA. They also sought a declaration that the publication by the Registrar is invalid. Magnotta declined to accept the withdrawal of publication of the marks by VQA as a settlement as they believed it did not render moot all the issues raised in their application. Magnotta has been using the VQA designation for its ICEWINE since 1991.VQA is a certification organization that works closely with provincial and federal governments to establish and administer standards for wines produced in Canada. Members of VQA are required to comply with its rules regulations and standards. In addition VQA has a cooperative agreement with the British Columbia Wine Institute and has established an appellation of origin system for wines produced in Ontario through its provincial corporation Vintners Quality Alliance of Ontario (VQAO). Magnotta as a member of VQA objected to its standards and provisions for inspection and perceived them as a restraint of trade.
