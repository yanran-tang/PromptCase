Richardson International Ltd. arrested the vessel Mys Chikhacheva in Nanaimo British Columbia due to a maritime lien for necessaries. The case involves issues of vessel ownership determining proper law and the existence of a maritime lien. Richardson provided a loan to Starodubskoe to refit their vessel and have exclusive rights to market the products. Issues arose when Bering Trawlers Ltd. claimed ownership of the vessel.Richardson loaned over $2.9 million to refit the Yuzhnie Kurily in 1995-1996 with a mortgage promissory note marketing contract and an addendum executed to protect its investment. Starodubskoe breached the agreement by selling production to third parties instead of fulfilling its contract with Richardson. The matter went to court where Richardson obtained a default judgment against Starodubskoe but could not recover the debt because Starodubskoe had filed for bankruptcy. Richardson only learned about Bering's alleged ownership of the Mys Chikhacheva during the case.Two experts one in Cypriot maritime law and the other in Russian maritime law have given conflicting conclusions on the ownership of the fishing trawler Mys Chikhacheva which was originally owned by fishing kolkhoz Kotovsky and later transfered to Starodubskoe. The defendant Bering claimed that they were the legal owners of the vessel while the plaintiff argued that no foreign company had the right of ownership to the vessel at the time of its registration in Russia in 1994. The experts also differed on the interpretation of articles 27 and 34 of the Merchant Marine Code.
