Canadian Pacific Hotels Corporation has been granted intervention in a class action lawsuit involving leases in Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba. The lawsuit questions whether the leases contain or should contain a perpetual renewal clause which the Crown argues is always null and void. Canadian Pacific which operates Banff and Lake Louise facilities on leased Banff National Park land with perpetual renewal clauses could be seriously affected by the lawsuit's outcome. The court ruled that Canadian Pacific's longer-term retrospective and commercial perspective could bring a different viewpoint to the proceedings which would assist the court in making determinations.
