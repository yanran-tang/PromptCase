nd hearing began on December 6 2004 and lasted four days. The judge notes that the Board's handling of the scheduling and organization of the hearing was less than satisfactory but ultimately finds that the Applicants received a fair hearing according to the principles of natural justice. 

Issue #2: Did the Board err in its assessment of the Applicant son-in-law's claim? The judge finds that the Board did err in its assessment by basing its finding of a lack of subjective fear on an incorrect assumption about the risk to the son-in-law's U.S. visa. However the judge ultimately upholds the Board's decision on this issue. 

Issue #3: Did the Board err in its assessment of the Applicants' risk by failing to consider evidence of risks to businessmen? The judge finds that the Board did not err in its assessment as the Applicants did not present sufficient evidence to establish a risk to them as businessmen.The case involves an appeal by the applicants claiming that they did not receive a fair hearing from the Board due to improper treatment before and during the hearing process. The applicants argue that the cumulative effect of the procedural difficulties and abusive questioning breached procedural fairness. The court disagreed stating that there was no evidence that the Board acted in bad faith and that the questioning did not amount to a reasonable apprehension of bias. The court found that to overturn a decision unfair treatment must be identifiable in terms of negative impacts or prejudice which the applicants failed to demonstrate.
