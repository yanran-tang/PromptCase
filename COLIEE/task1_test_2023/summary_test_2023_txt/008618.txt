This case concerns an application for prohibition under the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations regarding the process of producing the antibiotic norfloxacin. The applicants hold a patent for the process of manufacturing norfloxacin and are seeking to prohibit a competitor Apotex from producing it using a different process. The issue is whether Apotex's process infringes on the applicants' patent. The court examines the processes used by both parties and refers to a previous case that addressed a similar issue with a different antibiotic.The court is considering whether using protected piperazine in the process for making norfloxacin amounts to patent infringement as that was not considered in a previous case involving ciprofloxacin. Evidence has been presented showing that using protected piperazine results in higher yield and purity of the final product but the burden of proof is on the applicant (Apotex) to demonstrate that their alleged non-infringement is justified. The court will consider expert opinions from both sides.Experts compared the yields of the Torcan process in the 239 patent to the 961 process for norfloxacin with yields of over 90% for ciprofloxacin and 54-64% for norfloxacin. Merck's experts later analyzed the data and found that the actual yields in the examples were 65-69% for ciprofloxacin and there were impurities present. The Torcan process uses a protected piperazine which was found to be an invention in Canadian Patent 1326239.
