Pam Roe was a former part-time Data Control Clerk at Rogers Cablesystems Limited whose employment was terminated due to a legitimate reorganization. However other considerations played a part in her selection for termination which were not disclosed and constituted a failure to conform to procedural fairness. The adjudicator awarded Roe three quarters of the legal fees and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the hearing which Rogers challenged in a judicial review.An adjudicator found that while Rogers had the right to terminate part-time Data Control Clerks due to a department re-organization the company failed to disclose the considerations that led to the termination of Ms. Roe's employment which constituted a breach of procedural fairness. Ms. Roe was awarded compensation for three-quarters of the costs incurred in pursuing her complaint totaling around $53000.The case concerns the adjudicator's decision in the termination of employee Ms. Roe focusing on two issues: whether the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by concluding that the termination was not due to a lack of work or a discontinuance of function and whether the decision was based on erroneous findings of fact. The legislative framework for the case involves provisions in the Canada Labour Code including the appointment of an adjudicator to consider complaints and the power to order compensation or reinstatement in cases of unjust dismissal.
