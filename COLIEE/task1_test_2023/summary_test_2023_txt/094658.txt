The case concerns the application for judicial review of a decision made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Board which found the applicant not to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection because he was excluded from protection under Article 1F(a) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The applicant claimed a well-founded fear of persecution by insurgent elements of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) who would kill him because of his links to the Colombian armed forces. The Board accepted the refugee protection claims of the applicant's spouse minor child and mother-in-law but rejected the applicant's claim finding him excluded from convention protection due to his alleged complicity with crimes against humanity committed by the Colombian army. The Federal Court found that the Board misapplied the test for complicity and set aside the decision remitting the matter to another panel for redetermination.
