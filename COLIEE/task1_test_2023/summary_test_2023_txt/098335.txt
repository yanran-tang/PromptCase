The Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision not to deal with a complaint of sexual discrimination against the Treasury Board of Canada because it was based on acts that occurred more than one year before the complaint was filed has been overturned by the court. The case is to be remitted to the Commission for redetermination in accordance with directions that the court considered to be appropriate. The Commission had failed to exercise its discretion to extend the time limit beyond one year and had not provided adequate reasons for its determination.
