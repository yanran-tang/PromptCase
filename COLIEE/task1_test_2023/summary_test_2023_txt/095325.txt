The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by a delegate of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration denying a mother and her two children a ministerial exemption from the general requirements of immigration law based on the mother's marriage to a refugee. The court applies a high standard of proof requiring the applicants to show that the decision-maker erred in law acted in bad faith or proceeded on grounds unrelated to the purposes for which the discretion was granted which they did not satisfy.
