The case involves Cushman & Wakefield seeking to register their trademarks for real estate brokerage services in Canada but their application was opposed by Wakefield Realty Corporation who claimed that the trademarks were too similar to their existing trademarks and trade-name. The Trademarks Opposition Board dismissed the application and Cushman & Wakefield appealed to the Federal Court. The court's standard of review is reasonableness and additional evidence can be presented to challenge the Registrar's decision.A court ruling on a case involving the registration of trademarks for real estate services found that the Registrar had made a reasonable decision to refuse registration. The court held that if a tribunal provides reasons for its decision that can stand up to scrutiny then the decision would not be considered unreasonable. The applicant Cushman & Wakefield was unable to register its trademarks due to prior use and registration of similar marks by Wakefield Realty Corporation.
