The case concerns Kun Kwan Gao and his family's application for refugee status in Canada after being victims of several crimes including a violent rape in Panama. However the Refugee Protection Division determined that the family was excluded from refugee protection since they were permanent residents and enjoyed all the rights associated with nationality in Panama. The court found the decision to be reasonable and dismissed the application for review. The court also noted that the family did not provide enough evidence to rebut the presumption of State protection.
