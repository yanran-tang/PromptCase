The case involves an application by a group of applicants seeking to prevent the Minister of National Health and Welfare from issuing notices of compliance to Apotex Inc. for fluconazole tablets and capsules. Pfizer Canada Inc. filed a patent list on fluconazole and is seeking an injunction to prevent Apotex from marketing it until the expiry of the patent. The dispute centers on whether Apotex's process for manufacturing fluconazole infringes on Pfizer's patent. Apotex served a Notice of Allegation on Pfizer stating that it would not infringe on the patent. However Pfizer disputes the validity of the notice.Pfizer sought information on Apotex's process for manufacturing fluconazole during a patent dispute arguing that the process must be in Apotex's New Drug Submission (NDS). However Dr. Sherman who was called for cross-examination stated that the NDS only related to the dosage form and that a new Notice of Compliance was not needed to change the manufacturing process. It was subsequently revealed that the Apotex NDS was a cross-reference submission that did not include information on the chemistry and manufacturing.Pfizer brought a motion seeking documents related to Apotex's New Drug Submission which was withdrawn without prejudice. At a later hearing Pfizer argued that Apotex's evidence should be struck from the record because the documents had not been produced but the judge did not accept this argument because Pfizer had withdrawn the earlier motion.In a legal case involving Pfizer and Apotex it was argued that the non-disclosure of certain documents by Apotex breached an earlier court order. However Apotex argued that the documents didn't exist and therefore couldn't be produced. The court ultimately found that there was no breach and that the non-disclosure did not render Apotex's Notice of Allegation unjustified.
