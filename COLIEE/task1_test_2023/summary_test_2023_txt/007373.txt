Marcom Co. Ltd. has filed a motion to strike out the in rem aspects of the Statement of Claim and set aside the arrest of the Limanskiy a small refrigerator ship owned by Kasprybkholodflot. The ship issued and left at large three different sets of bills of lading causing confusion among competing claimants to a parcel of frozen roe herring. Kiku Fisheries Ltd. seeks delivery or damages as compensation for the frozen roe herring and the motion seeks to release the vessel by setting aside the arrest warrant. None of the defendants have filed a defense.Kiku holds a bill of lading for a shipment of herring from the Limanskiy vessel signed by the Master and showing IT & F as the shipper CNPOC as the consignee and Kiku as the notify address. However the bill was cancelled by IT & F Marcom and CNPOC and Kiku was not informed. Kiku later obtained an endorsement on the bill which was produced by CNPOC from a former officer of CNPOCâ€™s American sister company.Kiku claims that Mr. Kim had the authority to endorse bills of lading but CNPOC disagrees stating that Mr. Kim was associated with NPOC and was no longer employed. Moreover before Kiku could have its bills of lading endorsed CNPOC instructed IT & F to discharge the roe herring. When Kiku realized this the cargo had already been stored. There is conflicting evidence regarding whether the document authorizing the discharge of the cargo was backdated. The court explains that a heavy onus exists on a party seeking to strike out a pleading and that the court must assume the facts in the statement of claim to be true unless they are patently unreasonable.
