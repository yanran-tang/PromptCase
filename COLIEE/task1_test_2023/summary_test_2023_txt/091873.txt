Gurpreet Kaur Sandhu an Indian citizen applied for permanent residency as a skilled worker in Canada but a Visa Officer from the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi refused the application. Sandhu then applied for a judicial review of the decision under section 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act which was granted by the court due to the Visa Officer not seeking clarification on her doubts about Sandhu's responsibilities. The matter has been remitted for re-determination by a different visa officer.
