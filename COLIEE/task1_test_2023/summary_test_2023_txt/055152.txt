Mr. Parshottam a Muslim gay Ugandan citizen of East Indian descent sought protection in Canada after 18 years of permanent residency in the United States. The Immigration and Refugee Board found him excluded from refugee status under Section E of Article 1 of the United Nations Convention Relating To The Status Of Refugees. After seeking judicial review the Refugee Protection Division accepted his claim of persecution and granted him refugee status.Mr. Parshottam was denied refugee status by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) due to a lack of credibility. He then applied for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) and submitted new evidence regarding his status in the US including letters from a New York lawyer and the US Consulate. The PRRA officer rejected the evidence and found that Mr. Parshottam would not be at risk if returned to the US. Issues in this case include whether the new evidence should be accepted whether the PRRA officer applied the correct exclusion test whether she was correct in her assessment of Mr. Parshottam's status in the US and whether she breached natural justice by not disclosing a consent letter from the US.
