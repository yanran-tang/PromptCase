This application seeks judicial review of the Veterans’ Review and Appeal Board of Canada’s decision to award the applicant two fifths of a pension for only one of the four medical conditions he claimed were directly linked to Royal Canadian Mounted Police service. This is the third such review concerning this matter with previous orders being set aside for unreasonable error. The applicant’s identity is confidential and the medical conditions are unnamed but they include a serious autoimmune condition a viral condition a malignancy and a psychosomatic condition linked to stress.Mr. Doe a former RCMP officer has been denied a pension for his medical conditions related to his service. Two previous judicial reviews have found that the Board's decisions were patently unreasonable due to their narrow interpretation of the Pension Act and failure to consider medical evidence. The applicant argues that the presumptions in subsection 21(3)(f) apply but the Board has not provided a clear explanation as to why they do not.The article discusses a case where an individual's workplace stress led to multiple medical conditions including a malignant condition. The Pension Board initially only granted pension for one condition but has now acknowledged the link between the workplace stressors and the individual's medical conditions. The medical evidence presented clearly establishes the connection but the Board appeared to have disregarded the empirical data and formal scientific rationale.
