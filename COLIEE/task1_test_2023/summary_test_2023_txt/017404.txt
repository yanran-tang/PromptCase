Mrs. Chen a Canadian permanent resident sponsored by her Canadian husband was prevented from sponsoring her son from China An Bo Xie due to paragraph 117(9)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations. The Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed her appeal stating that the appellant did not disclose her son in due course prohibiting him from being examined and precluding her from sponsoring him at a later date. Mrs. Chen sought judicial review of this decision but the court ruled against her stating that her non-disclosure was deliberate and she had the responsibility to understand the consequences of not including her son.
