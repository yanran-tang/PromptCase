The judicial review concerned a decision by disciplinary chairperson Mr. Dean Fox at Kent Institution in Agassiz B.C. where the applicant's cell was located. The applicant was charged with being unlawfully in possession of a shank which was discovered in a routine search of the applicant's possessions including a 12 inch fan. The chairperson found the applicant guilty of the offence but the court deemed it a patently unreasonable verdict and quashed the decision.
