The applicants Dharamraj and Jasmatie Dharamraj applied for an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds to permit inland processing of their permanent residence application. The immigration officer refused the application citing that there was not sufficient hardship. The applicants sought judicial review of the decision on the grounds that the officer's assessment of hardship was inadequate she erred in failing to consider the risk factors in her assessment and she breached the duty of procedural fairness. The court found that the officer had erred in failing to consider the risk factors in the H&C application and allowed the application for judicial review to be referred to a different officer for re-determination.
