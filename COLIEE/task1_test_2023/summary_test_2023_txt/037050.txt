Felipe Morales Filigrana and his family sought international protection in Canada under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. They claimed they were in danger in their homeland Mexico but their claim was dismissed by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board on the grounds of credibility and lack of state protection. The family argued that they were afraid for their lives and that state protection was inadequate but the court found that the evidence presented did not allow for the conclusion that the Mexican state was unable to protect them.
