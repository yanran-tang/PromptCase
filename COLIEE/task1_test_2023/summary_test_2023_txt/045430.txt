The case is an Application for Judicial Review of a decision by a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Officer. The Officer had found the applicant not credible and rejected their application for protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Court considered whether personal identifiers of the applicant and their home state should be deleted from the published reasons and order to protect their interests ultimately granting a confidentiality order.A court has ruled that the salutary effects of a confidentiality order outweigh the right to free expression in an ongoing legal case with personal identifiers and the applicant's home state being suppressed. The case involves a refugee claimant who fears persecution if returned to their home state in the former Soviet Union. The claimant's initial claim was not pursued by their representative and was abandoned in 2002 with the application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment being filed in 2007.
