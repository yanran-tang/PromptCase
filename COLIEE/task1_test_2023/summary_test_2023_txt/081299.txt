Ms. Wendy Price sought judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision to not deal with her complaint against Concord Transportation Inc. She claimed that the company discriminated against her and her driver on the basis of sex as they did not hire him because he worked for a female truck owner. The Commission initially denied assistance citing grounds that did not apply to Price's case.The case involves a woman who filed a complaint of discrimination against a transportation company for hiring a less qualified man for the same job. The Canadian Human Rights Commission investigated the case despite the complaint being filed more than one year after the alleged discriminatory act occurred. The transportation company argued that the delay could prejudice their case but the Commission proceeded with the investigation prompting the company to seek judicial review.
