A family from Mexico sought refugee status and protection in Canada after claiming they were under threat from local criminals but their claims were rejected by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). The family failed to provide evidence to support their fear and had not sought help from the police. They petitioned for a judicial review of the decision but it was dismissed by the Federal Court.
