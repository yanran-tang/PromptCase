Apotex requested dismissal of an application for an order prohibiting the Minister of National Health and Welfare from issuing a notice of compliance to Apotex in respect of the drug lovostatin filed by Merck pursuant to s. 6(1) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations. Apotex argued that the prohibition application was moot and constituted an abuse of process. The court denied Apotex's request but fixed a date for the hearing on the merits of the application for prohibition.
