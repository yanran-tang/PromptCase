This case involves a judicial review of a decision made by Director Eugène C. Léger regarding a pension benefits division between the applicant and respondent stemming from a prior divorce judgement. The Pension Benefits Division Act allows for division of pension benefits in the case of divorce or written agreement and Section 7(3)(e) allows for refusal if the Minister deems it unjust. The Superannuation Directorate dismissed the applicant's objection leading to a previous application for judicial review and another notice of objection was filed leading to the current review.The case involves an objection to the division of pension benefits where the applicant argues that it would be unjust due to financial repercussions. The Director denies the objection stating that the division would only be refused in rare circumstances where compelling evidence is presented. The applicant argues that the Director lacks the appropriate capacity to act in place of the Minister and failed to take important factors into consideration.The case questions whether an advisory officer can act in place of the Minister but the Director can't however the judge rejects this argument as the Minister doesn't necessarily have to personally exercise their authority. While the Act doesn't explicitly empower delegation of authority by the Minister it's reasonable to assume department officials will act on the Minister's behalf within their respective grants of authority. The respondent's argument that the Director is a delegate of the Minister is rejected.
