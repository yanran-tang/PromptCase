The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration brought an application for judicial review seeking to quash the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board which allowed the appeal of a Canadian citizen to approve his application for permanent residence for his adopted son. The Minister argued that the relationship between the respondent and the adoptee did not establish a legal relationship of parent and child. The court found that the definition of adopted in the Regulations must be read to require not only compliance with adoption laws but also the establishment of a relationship of parent and child. The matter was referred back to the Board for redetermination.
