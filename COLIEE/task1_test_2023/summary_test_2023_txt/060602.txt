The case involves an interlocutory motion for a stay of the removal order issued against the applicant. The applicant was found to have criminality and failed to demonstrate that there is a serious issue to be tried on the application for judicial review that he would suffer irreparable harm if he were deported to Mexico and that the balance of convenience lies in his favour. Thus the court orders the motion to stay the removal order to be dismissed.
