This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to award $105000 in legal costs to Cecil Brooks who filed a complaint of discrimination against his former employer the Canadian Coast Guard. The Tribunal partially substantiated his claim and awarded damages for hurt feelings and legal costs. The applicant challenged the Tribunal's jurisdiction to award costs rejected written offers to settle and disputed the assessment of legal costs.The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decided that a complainant who has been discriminated against should not be required to pay a significant amount of money for their claim. Subsection 53(2) of the Act outlines several possible remedies that the Tribunal can invoke should a complaint be substantiated including compensation for the victim's pain and suffering. The applicant believes that this decision is in line with the idea that the cure should not be worse than the disease.
