The motion to strike out Addo's claim has been denied and the motion for security costs has been allowed in the sum of $5000. Addo may proceed against the other defendants without providing security for costs in the case against Hesse Noord.George Addo hired Time and Long Island to transport his cargo from Toronto to Takoradi Ghana which included a 1992 Toyota truck that was discovered to belong to another defendant in the case. After his cargo was dropped in the Port of Antwerp and restuffed into other containers causing a delay OTAL claims that the incident is time-barred while Addo seeks compensation for the delay.
