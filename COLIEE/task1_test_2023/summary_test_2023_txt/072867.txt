The case involves an interlocutory injunction against Correctional Service Canada (CSC) from allowing the temperature to drop below a certain point in the Temporary Detention Unit (TDU) at Matsqui Institution. Inmates in the TDU are denied extra blankets or clothing during periods when the unit is ventilated due to smokers causing discomfort and cold temperatures which can be dangerous for inmates with illnesses like HIV/AIDS or Hepatitis C. The Applicants claim that their complaints were not acted upon while the Respondent claims that extra clothing and blankets were offered.The court affirms its decision to require a smoking ban in a Toronto detention center's transitional housing unit due to health concerns. The ban does not place an undue burden on the facility and its costs are outweighed by the benefits of a healthier environment. The decision is based on relevant laws and evidence supporting the need for a safe and healthy living environment for inmates and staff. A complete smoking ban may soon be imposed affecting the scope of the remedy.
