The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) was condemned to pay around $550000 to the plaintiff for failing to provide prompt payment when demand was made after the guarantee provided in lieu of bail was ignored. The Bank argued that the court order presented did not state the claims but this excuse was considered invalid. The initial security failure and the bank's perfunctory reaction suggest that providers of contractual security should be available to respond when claimed as well as delivering good service with quickness and practicality.
