IKEA filed a motion for an interlocutory injunction against a furniture store called IDEA and IDEA AND DESIGN located across from its store in Victoria B.C. arguing that the names were confusingly similar. The court found that while the visual similarity between the names was not strong the sound of the names was similar enough to potentially cause confusion. However the court also found that IKEA had not shown irreparable harm and that an injunction could harm the smaller IDEA operation. Additionally the court found that IKEA had delayed seeking the injunction allowing IDEA to establish its business and thus denied the motion. The defendants were ordered to keep an account of their sales and issue a disclaimer to their customers.
