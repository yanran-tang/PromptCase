The applicant seeks to set aside an immigration officer's decision to refuse permission to make an application for landing from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The application seeks mandamus requiring the officer to grant such permission a remedy not available since there is no duty on the immigration officer to grant permission. The applicant challenges the decision arguing that the officer gave no reasons for the decision although no reasons are necessary. The applicant has been living in Canada since December 1991 and has a wife who is a Canadian citizen and two Canadian born children. However charges had been laid against him in the United States for fraud and tax evasion. He asserts that he is innocent but did not return to the United States to deal with the charges. His sponsor filed for him and he subsequently filed for permission to make an application for landing from within Canada. Great weight should have been given to the bona fides of the marriage and the applicant should have been allowed to apply for landing from within Canada the question of his criminal inadmissibility being left to be decided at a later date in the context of making a decision on that application. However his application is dismissed.
