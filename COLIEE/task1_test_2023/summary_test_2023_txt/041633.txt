This case concerns an application for judicial review of a visa officer's decision to deny an applicant's permanent residency due to his son's medical condition which was deemed likely to cause excessive demands on health or social services. The court must determine whether the visa officer erred in this conclusion as well as address several preliminary issues related to the disclosure of medical records and the consistency of regulations with the Immigration Act.The court rules that the medical record including the evaluation by medical officers is important in assessing the reasonableness of the visa officer's decision. Furthermore the court confirms that only evidence that was before the decision-maker can be considered on judicial review. The respondent claims that Dr. Ford's report was not part of the medical officers' record but the court finds that it was based on circumstantial evidence. Ultimately the court concludes that Dr. Ford's report can be considered on judicial review.
