The case of Josué Bernard and Fabiola Bernard v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration revolves around Fabiola who was not originally declared by her father Josué when he became a permanent resident of Canada as he did not know she existed. When he found out he acknowledged her under Haitian law and his subsequent attempts to sponsor her have been repeatedly denied. The court found that the immigration officer did not adequately consider humanitarian and compassionate considerations and remanded the matter to another officer to redetermine the application.
