The applicant Tamer Mohamed Shawky Ahmad El Sherbiny had his permanent resident visa application under the Federal Skilled Worker class refused by a visa officer of Citizenship and Immigration Canada. El Sherbiny had alleged that he had a family relationship with a permanent resident living in Canada which would have provided him with the points required for his application to succeed. However the visa officer was not satisfied that this represented evidence of an eligible family relationship and ultimately rejected the application due to the lack of sufficient documentation. The Federal Court dismissed El Sherbiny's application for judicial review.
