The plaintiffs Fibreco Pulp Inc. sent wood-pulp to Ekman Leibig AB of Goteborg Sweden which was then shipped to Enso-Gutzeit OY in Finland on the Star Dover and Star Gran. The defendants are contesting the way in which the action has been commenced and are bringing motions for stays in favour of litigation and arbitration due to large amounts at stake. The COA is governed by English law with disputes to be arbitrated in London.The case involves the transportation of pulp from Squamish British Columbia to Kotka Finland via Rotterdam. The two ships used Star Dover and Star Gran are owned by nebulous owners making it difficult to determine liability. The bills of lading name Star Shipping A/S as the carrier with a Himalaya clause extending benefits to its agents and independent contractors. The bills of lading also mention Rotterdam as the discharge port but note that the cargo is to be on-carried to Kotka Finland.  Overall the case involves determining liability for damages caused during the maritime transportation of the pulp.The case involves disputes over bills of lading and damages to pulp that was delivered to Kotka Finland in a damaged state. Star Shipping Stephanie Co. and F.S. Switynk seek a stay for arbitration in London or to strike out the action as improperly commenced. Dover and Kraft Line also seek a stay and an order to strike out the in rem claim against the Star Gran and return the security. The judge granted the stay and dealt with the alleged improper joining of causes of action.
