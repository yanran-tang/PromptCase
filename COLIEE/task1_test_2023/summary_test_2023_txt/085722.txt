Roger Ladouceur sought an increase in his pension entitlement for his post-traumatic arthritis in his left ankle which was denied by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board. Ladouceur appealed this decision as the board failed to give meaningful reasons for dismissing his appeal. The court found that the board's reasons were insufficient and a denial of procedural fairness to Ladouceur and the matter was remitted to a different panel of the Board for re-determination.
