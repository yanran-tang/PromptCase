Afzul Abdul Kha Miah a citizen of Bangladesh and member of the Awami League claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution based on his political opinion. The Refugee Protection Division initially rejected his claim but it was set aside by the Federal Court of Appeal. At a second hearing the Board again rejected his claim due to doubts about his identity. The Court allowed his application for judicial review finding that the Board's decision was made without regard to the evidence and was thus patently unreasonable. The matter was remitted for redetermination before a differently constituted panel of the Refugee Protection Division.
