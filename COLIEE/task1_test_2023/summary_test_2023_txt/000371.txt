The case concerns Fahmey Abdalla Ali Abubakar's claim for refugee status based on his membership in the Isaaq clan and political opinion. The Board determined that the changes in northern Somalia were sufficient to remove the applicant's fear of persecution based on his membership in the Isaaq clan. However the Federal Court found that the Board did not fully apply the test in assessing Hargeisa as an internal flight alternative and thus set aside the decision and referred the matter for rehearing and reconsideration.
