Mexican citizens sought refugee protection from government authorities in Mexico due to political opinion-based persecution. The Refugee Protection Division found that an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) was available to them in Mexico City. However evidence on the record indicated that an IFA was not available to the Applicants anywhere in Mexico rendering the RPD decision patently unreasonable. The case was referred back to a differently constituted panel for re-determination.
