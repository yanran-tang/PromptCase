The Income Tax Act has no time limitation on the Minister's ability to collect unpaid taxes. This case involves a dispute over whether the statutory collection powers are subject to a limitation period. The applicant Mr. Markevich owes over $770000 in unpaid taxes from the 1980s that were previously written off by Revenue Canada. Markevich argues that the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act limits collection while the Minister argues that it does not. The case comes before the court through an application for judicial review.Revenue Canada has included previously written-off tax debts in statements of account and requirements to pay issued to taxpayers' debtors. The inclusion of a large outstanding amount in any requirements to pay could be harmful to taxpayers' businesses. The court's jurisdiction to entertain this matter was questioned by the respondent but the court held that the subject-matter of an application for judicial review is not limited to only decisions or orders but also administrative action that other tribunals take.This legal document discusses the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in Canada in relation to tax debts owed by individuals particularly in regards to the issuing of requirements to pay. The author argues that the court should be able to entertain a challenge to the issuance of a requirement to pay even if the ground of challenge could not have been raised by the taxpayer upon receiving notice of assessment. Important statutory provisions are cited throughout.
