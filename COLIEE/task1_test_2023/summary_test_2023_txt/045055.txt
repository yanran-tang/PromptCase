This case involves an application for leave regarding the refusal of a temporary residency visa for Mady Danioko to come to Canada on business. The visa officer refused the application as they did not believe Danioko had sufficient financial resources to make the trip and was not convinced the reasons for the trip were credible. The court found that the visa officer made no errors in fact or law in their decision and that the decision was well-founded. The court also affirmed the standard of review for discretionary decisions made by visa officers to be deferential.
