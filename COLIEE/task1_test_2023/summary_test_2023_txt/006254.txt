Abdel Hakim Ayaichia claimed refugee status upon his arrival in Canada in 2004. He alleged fear of persecution claiming to be a witness to a murder by a former terrorist in Algeria. However the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) rejected his claims stating that he was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Ayaichia applied for judicial review claiming that the IRB breached procedural fairness and that it failed to conduct a separate analysis of his claim under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. However his application was dismissed as he has failed to demonstrate that the IRB committed any reviewable error.
