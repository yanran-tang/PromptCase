Dr. Sylvio Tessier's affidavit is being tendered by the plaintiff as expert evidence in support of its case but the defendants are objecting to the admissibility of certain paragraphs. The objections relate to the admissibility of opinion evidence on the construction of the patent and the judge begins by considering the relevant authorities. The judge ultimately rules that some objections are sustained but others are overruled.In a legal case regarding the interpretation of a patent the admissibility of expert opinion was questioned by the court. One judge cited a lack of authority while another found contrary evidence to support allowing expert testimony on the ultimate issue of construction. The judge who supported the admissibility of expert opinion argued that it could be helpful to the trier of fact in deciding issues such as anticipation or obviousness.
