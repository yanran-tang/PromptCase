This case involves a judicial review of the Registrar of Trademarks' decision to publish official marks in the name of the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) for the words SEE YOU IN TORINO SEE YOU IN BEIJING and SEE YOU IN VANCOUVER which the applicant Canadian Athletes Fund Corporation (SYI Fund) had already filed trademark applications for. SYI Fund had raised over $2 million to support Canadian athletes and had filed for trademarks in 2003. COC requested public notice under s. 9 of the Trade-marks Act for their own official marks which were later published by the Registrar thus precluding SYI Fund from registering their previously filed trademarks. The case raises issues around evidence adoption and use licensing and whether COC is a public authority.The case concerns a trademark that closely resembles a mark used by a public authority in Canada. The relevant section of the Act prohibits the adoption of such a mark. The standard of review for decisions made by the Registrar of Trademarks is generally reasonableness but can be correctness if new evidence is introduced. The admissible evidence in this case did not change the result as the trademark in question was deemed too similar to the public authority's mark.This document discusses the admissibility of evidence in a judicial review case involving the multi-party agreement between COC and various governments. The Respondent sought to strike the affidavit evidence but the Court held that third parties have an interest in the Registrar's decision and a legitimate right to challenge it. The Court also noted that evidence challenging the conclusions of the Registrar may be admissible on issues of procedural fairness and jurisdiction with leave of the Court.
