The applicant sought to challenge the decision of an immigration officer who found insufficient grounds to allow her landing application to be processed from within Canada. The duty of fairness varies with each case and the consequences of the decision for the individual are significant. The immigration officer's decision was found to have overlooked the applicant's present relationship with her family and the application was granted. The notes of the immigration officer serve as an indication of the decision-making process but they should not be elevated to formal reasons.
