Jawwad Ahmed and his family citizens of Pakistan sought judicial review of the Immigration and Refugee Board's decision that they were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Mr. Ahmed claimed a fear of persecution due to his political opinion and his family's claim was based on their relationship to him. The Board found some of his evidence not credible and dismissed the sur place submission. The Federal Court quashed the Board's decision and ordered a differently constituted Board to reconsider their claim.
