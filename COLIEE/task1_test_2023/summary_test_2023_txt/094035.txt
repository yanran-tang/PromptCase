George Flynn while incarcerated at La Macaza Correctional Institution had his contact visits with his common law wife Elizabeth Boucher suspended. Flynn sought a writ of mandamus under the Federal Courts Act to challenge the suspension but the principal request in his application is now moot since he has served his sentence. The Federal Court is nevertheless considering whether a reviewable error was committed in suspending Flynn's contact visits.The applicant and his spouse are accused of smuggling narcotics and cash into a prison through private family visits. Investigations concluded that their actions posed a threat to the security of the institution. The applicant denies the allegations but his contact visits have been suspended indefinitely. The Regional Deputy Commissioner upheld the decision and the applicant's third-level grievance was also rejected. The applicant claims that the suspension of visits with his spouse has affected their health.
