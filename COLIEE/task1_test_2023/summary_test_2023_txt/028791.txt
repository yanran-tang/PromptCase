The case involves Bawo Ariri a Nigerian citizen and permanent resident of Canada who was convicted of various crimes including fraud over $5000 which led to a deportation order. Ariri attempted to appeal the order but the Immigration Appeal Division denied it citing his prison sentence of at least two years. Ariri filed an application to reopen the appeal arguing that his pre-sentence custody should not have been considered punishment. However the IAD rejected his application stating their initial decision was correct in law and the Federal Court dismissed Ariri's application for judicial review.
