Ms. Paratima Vashishat a permanent resident of Canada applied to sponsor her father and brother as members of the family class category. However her brother who is a citizen of India was found inadmissible due to his state of mental development potentially causing excessive demands on health or social services. Ms. Vashishat appealed the decision but the Immigration Appeal Division dismissed it. The case was then taken to court for judicial review and it was found that the IAD did not properly consider the applicants' actual circumstances in determining the likelihood of excessive demands on social services. The matter was remitted to another panel for re-consideration.
