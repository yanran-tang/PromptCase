The applicant sought permanent residence in Canada under s. 6(1) of the Immigration Act but was refused based on the visa officer's assessment that the applicant did not have the necessary experience for his intended occupation. The applicant argued the visa officer's assessment was based on his current position rather than his actual experience. However the court found that the visa officer considered all components of the applicant's work experience and there was evidence to support the assessment. The application was dismissed.
