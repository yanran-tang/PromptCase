The case concerns an unsuccessful refugee claim by a family from Sri Lanka where the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) found the principal Applicant not credible and concluded that they had a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Colombo. The Federal Court quashed the decision citing errors by IRB for ignoring the evidence of risk to Tamils living in Colombo and failing to conduct a proper analysis of s. 97 claim for protection and remitted the matter back to a differently constituted panel.
