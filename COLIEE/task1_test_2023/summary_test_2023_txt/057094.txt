The appellant in this case claimed he had a well-founded fear of persecution from the Ghana government for opposing their efforts to legitimize themselves but the panel found him neither trustworthy nor credible. The Board determined that recent changes in the country's political climate meant that the applicant was less likely to face persecution although the Federal Court found the changes not to be meaningful or effective. The Board's credibility findings were also questioned and the matter was ordered to be reheard by a differently constituted panel.
