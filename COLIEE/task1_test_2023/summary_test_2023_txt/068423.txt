Tara Jenkins and Sean Winstanley both Fishery Officers with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in the Atlantic Region filed a complaint with the Public Service Commission stating that they were not appointed to their positions in a timely manner in violation of the Fishery Officer Career Progression Program. They challenged the failure to appoint them to the GT-03 working level FO position in a timely manner after completing their final 12-month training period under the old program. The case involves the length of time an applicant has to spend at the FO working level minus 1.The Public Service Commission (PSC) declared that it did not have jurisdiction over the determination of conversions from the old program to the new and that staff relations grievances should handle the matter. As a result an investigation under section 7.1 of the PSEA was not conducted. Sections 6 7.1 8 and 10 of the Public Service Employment Act were referenced and the appropriate standard of review was determined to be that of correctness.
