The applicants are seeking a judicial review of an immigration officer's decision to refuse their humanitarian and compassionate (H & C) application to permit inland processing of their permanent residence application. They alleged they fled South Korea due to being threatened by organized criminals and their state was unable to offer protection. The officer denied the H & C application stating the applicants' current establishment in Canada and the risk of return to South Korea submitted by the applicants would not result in unusual undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The decision was upheld as reasonable.
