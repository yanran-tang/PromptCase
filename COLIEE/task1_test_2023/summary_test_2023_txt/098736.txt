Mr. Zi Qi Xiao a businessman from China seeks to challenge a decision made by Officer Chan in 2008 who refused his application for permanent residency in Canada. Mr. Xiao's son was deemed inadmissible for criminality due to an offense he committed in Hong Kong and Mr. Xiao wishes to challenge this finding.Mr. Xiao's son Baian was initially denied a permanent resident visa to Canada due to concerns that his actions in Hong Kong would constitute an offence under Canadian law. After submitting additional evidence including a legal opinion from a former government lawyer in Hong Kong an offer was made to set aside the initial decision and remit the application to a different visa officer. However a subsequent decision still found Baian to be criminally inadmissible leading to a final refusal of the visa application.
