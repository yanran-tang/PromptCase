Nixon Valère's refugee claim was rejected due to serious reasons to believe he was complicit in crimes against humanity by the Haitian National Police. Valère seeks to have the decision set aside asserting that the evidence before the board did not support such a finding. The only issue is whether the board erred in its conclusion that Valère was excluded from the definition of a refugee due to his complicity in crimes against humanity. The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is remitted to a differently constituted panel for redetermination.
