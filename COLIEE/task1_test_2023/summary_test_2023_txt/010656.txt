This case involves a judicial review of a decision by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade concerning an access to information request filed by Ken Rubin. The applicant sought environmental screening records related to the sale of Candu nuclear reactors to China. The court addresses two issues: the late release of one of the requested reports and whether the other report was under the control of the government institution. The application for judicial review is ultimately dismissed.
