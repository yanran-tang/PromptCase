The defendant seeks summary judgment to dismiss the plaintiff's action for patent infringement. The plaintiff received a patent for a multiple section draw bar in 1981 and later filed for a reissue of the patent in 1985 claiming errors in the original patent. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's own admissions during examination for discovery justify dismissing the action.The case concerns a reissued patent and whether it is valid or not under the Patent Act. The defendant argues that the petition contained untrue material and the reissue patent was issued without authority making it invalid. The plaintiff's revisions to the original patent are also discussed. The defendant seeks summary judgment dismissing the action.
