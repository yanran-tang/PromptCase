Liru Yang claimed refugee status in Canada due to her fear of persecution in China as a follower of Falun Gong. However a panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed her claim concluding that she had fabricated the whole story as a way to become a Canadian resident. Ms. Yang appealed arguing that the Board failed to consider the risk she might face in China due to her Falun Gong activities in Canada but the court dismissed her application for judicial review.
