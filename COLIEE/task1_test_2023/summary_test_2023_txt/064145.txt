Defendants in a Canadian court case are seeking to have the case moved to Cyprus which they argue is the most appropriate forum for the matter at hand. The case concerns the sinking of a cargo ship with only four of the 25 crew members surviving. The plaintiffs argue that the Canadian court is the appropriate forum and the general rule is that a plaintiff's choice of forum will not be disturbed unless the balance strongly favors the defendant.
