The applicant in this case sought judicial review of the decision made by a visa officer to refuse his application for permanent residence in Canada. The applicant argued that the visa officer erred in law by failing to formally assess him as an Advertising/Marketing Consultant and that he wrongly interpreted the occupational definition of NOC 1122.2. The court found that the visa officer erred in his consideration of the applicant's qualification for the intended occupation and the matter was remitted to a different visa officer for determination.
