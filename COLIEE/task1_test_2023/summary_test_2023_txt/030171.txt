The plaintiffs sought to strike out a paragraph from the statements of defence of two defendants which stated that they were estopped from denying certain elements of the invention. The court initially struck out the paragraph but the defendants included a similar paragraph in amended statements of defence. The plaintiffs moved to strike these paragraphs arguing that the defendants were not entitled to rely on statements made in the prosecution of the patent application to establish estoppel. The court agreed and struck out the paragraphs.
