The plaintiffs seek an order to deem their action commenced by a Statement of Claim to be a judicial review proceeding to allow it to proceed as an action and to amend the Statement of Claim to reflect events arising after it was issued and seek additional relief. The defendants argue the plaintiffs made a fatal mistake and should have filed for judicial review within 30 days as required by Section 18.1 of the Federal Court Act. The court ultimately dismisses the application to deem the action a judicial review proceeding.
