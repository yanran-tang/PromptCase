This case involves a complaint of unjust dismissal made by Curtis Bartibogue against the Esgenôpetitj (Burnt Church) First Nation which was assigned to inspector Alma Boucher. The Applicant Esgenôpetitj did not respond to Boucher's request for reasons for Bartibogue's dismissal so Boucher forwarded the complaint form to the Minister including additional job titles. The Minister appointed an adjudicator but the Applicant later discovered the complaint form had been altered and requested an adjournment. The Applicant now seeks to appeal an order dismissing their motion for judicial review which is dismissed as an abuse of process.The Applicant filed two judicial review applications challenging the Inspector and Minister's decision to submit an altered complaint form for adjudication. Despite no stay motion being brought by the Applicant the adjudication was completed on March 23 2010. The Respondent advised the Applicant to discontinue the applications or face a motion to strike to which the Applicant did not file submissions. The Prothonotary granted the motions to strike and the Applicant filed appeals but also sought judicial review of the Adjudicator's decision. Respondent's counsel offered not to seek costs in relation to the Rule 51 motions if the Applicant discontinued them.
