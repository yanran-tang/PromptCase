This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision to refuse a permanent resident visa as a member of the Canadian experience class. The applicant who is deaf and primarily uses sign language to communicate was not deemed to meet the official language proficiency requirements. The application for judicial review was ultimately dismissed.A Canadian man who is deaf has challenged the refusal of his application for a permanent resident visa following a claim by an immigration officer that he did not satisfy the official English-language proficiency requirement for Canadian resident applicants. The applicant scored 9.2 out of 10 for expressive skills in American Sign Language (ASL) and 9 out of 10 for receptive skills but only got 3.5 in the reading and writing elements of an English-language test. The manâ€™s case raises issues about whether the regulation violated the right to equality guaranteed by section 15(1) of the Charter.
