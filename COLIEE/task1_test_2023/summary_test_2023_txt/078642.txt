The defendant is seeking the dismissal of the plaintiff's wrongful dismissal claim after she was physically disabled and discharged from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They argue that no proceedings can be made against the Crown if a pension or compensation has been paid for the injury or disability under the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act and Pension Act. Additionally the plaintiff's administrative discharge grievance procedure precludes an action for wrongful dismissal against the Crown.A wrongful dismissal case has been filed against the Crown alleging that the plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed from her job. The issue at hand is whether the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act would preclude the plaintiff's action in contract. Section 9 states that no proceedings can be made against the Crown or any of its servants in respect of a claim if a pension or compensation has been paid but it is unclear whether this provision extends to actions in contract. Additionally the plaintiff argues that the Pension Act may also bar her action.
