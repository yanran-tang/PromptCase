The case involves an application for an extension of time to serve and file a record. The court reviews the four elements necessary for a time extension and finds that the applicant has a continuing intention to pursue the application there is no apparent prejudice to the respondent and there is a reasonable explanation for the delay. However the court also notes that there is no evidence to suggest that the applicant's case has merit and the applicant's reply to the respondent's argument does not deal with the merits of the case. The court balances fairness to the parties and allows the applicant to file an amended motion record.
