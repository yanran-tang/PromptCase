The case involves a judicial review application by Navjot Singh a Sikh farmer and citizen of India who claimed he was persecuted and tortured by the police in Punjab due to suspicion of his ties to militants. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected his claim stating that his account was not credible. The court dismissed the application for judicial review finding that the panel did not make an error in finding the applicant lacked credibility.
