Ms. Doret a citizen of Haiti applied for a temporary resident visa to Canada to visit her fianc√© and sisters. The visa officer refused her application citing concerns that Ms. Doret may not leave Canada at the end of her stay. Ms. Doret sought a judicial review of the decision which was eventually dismissed due to a lack of evidence supporting her case and the reasonableness of the visa officer's decision. Furthermore there was no breach of natural justice or procedural fairness as an interview was not necessary for the decision.
