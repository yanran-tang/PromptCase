This is a case concerning an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Immigration and Refugee Board to deny refugee status to a Kurdish- Iraqi man who feared persecution in his homeland. The Board found that an Internal Flight Alternative was available in a controlled area of northern Iraq under Kurdish government and the court found no error in the Board's assessment of the evidence in regards to a change of circumstances in Iraq and the availability of an IFA. The application was dismissed.
