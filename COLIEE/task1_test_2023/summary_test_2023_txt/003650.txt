This is a judicial review of a decision made by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board in 1997. The applicant seeks to have the decision quashed and be granted a disability pension benefit due to injuries sustained during military service in 1958-1959 including hearing loss from rifle firing and injuries to the knees and lower back. The Board denied the claim stating that the injuries could be attributed to a workplace accident and insufficient medical evidence.The case involves an applicant who contests the conclusions of the Board with regards to the linkage between his spinal condition and his military service. The applicant also questions the quality of the medical exam given to him at the time of his discharge. The respondent objects to much of the evidence presented by the applicant and argues that the Board conducted its proceedings in accordance with its statutory obligations. The court cannot consider any evidence not before the decision-maker and the Board retains jurisdiction to reconsider its decision on the basis of new evidence.
