Charles Webster a taxpayer is seeking a declaration injunction and writ to stop the Minister of National Revenue from taking any actions under sections 225.1(1)(a) to (g) of the Income Tax Act. He claims that the Minister has no authority to proceed with collection action against him as he has appealed to the Tax Court of Canada from the assessments against him. The amount in issue was $98251.78.The case involves a dispute over whether s. 225.1(5) of the Income Tax Act overrides the statutory stay imposed on collections actions during the appeal process. The applicant argues that his appeal is not subject to the statutory stay because the issues raised differ from those in a test case and he did not agree to delay his appeal. The respondent argues that s. 225.1(5) allows taxpayers to delay pursuing a Notice of Objection or an appeal but not both and an assessment of issue similarity is subjective.
