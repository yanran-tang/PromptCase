Mark Okechukwu Nnawuihe a Nigerian citizen and member of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) claimed refugee protection after officials terrorised his family and businesses. The Immigration and Refugee Board denied his claim and Nnawuihe sought a judicial review to challenge its credibility findings. The Federal Court rejected the application noting that the Board's findings were open to question and that the applicant failed to provide satisfactory explanations for discrepancies between his documents.
