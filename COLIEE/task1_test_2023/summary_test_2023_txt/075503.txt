The applicant applied for permanent residence in Canada as a Chef-Cook but the visa officer found he had no training or experience in that occupation and instead assessed him as an Assistant Manager Restaurant which had no demand. Despite the applicant's argument for a personal interview and s.11(3) consideration there was no evidence to support this and the judicial review was dismissed. The applicant's proposed questions for certification were also dismissed as there was no reasonable indication to support them.
