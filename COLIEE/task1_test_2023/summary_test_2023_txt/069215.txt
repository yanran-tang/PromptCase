Marian Kamara a citizen of Sierra Leone sought judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) that she was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection from persecution under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Kamara alleged that her brother-in-law an ex-Rebel and current member of the Sierra Leonean army insisted on marrying her and threatened to kill her if she did not comply with his demand. The Board determined that Kamara was not a credible witness and that she manufactured evidence for the benefit of her claim. Kamara argued that the guideline concerning the standard order of questioning violated the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness and that the Board member's questioning was conducted in an unfair way and that the Board's decision was based on erroneous findings of fact; however the court found no merit in Kamara's arguments and dismissed her application for judicial review.
