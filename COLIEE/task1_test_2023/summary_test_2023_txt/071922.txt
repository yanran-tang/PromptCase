The appeal case involves five creditors who supplied necessaries to the ship 'Lanner' or alleged sister ships. They believe their claims outrank the mortgage but Prothonotary Morneau awarded the mortgage holder with priority. However most of the necessaries were supplied outside of Canada and allegedly governed by US law which can outrank a mortgage in certain circumstances. The issue of the distribution of the sale proceeds of the ship is vital and the Court will exercise discretion and intervene if needed.Fifteen creditors filed claims against the proceeds of sale of the ship Lanner but only five remained referred to as Claimants. The Claimants contracted with the ship's owner and its managing agent Arrow Ltd. stipulating American law as applicable. JP Morgan Chase Bank lent Mystras Maritime the ship's then owner a principal amount of US $27500000. After the borrowers defaulted the plaintiffs took possession of and sold the ship. The Claimants' issues include the validity of the plaintiff's claims which the Claimants challenge citing lack of evidence.agraph 5). Mrs. Suvarnatemee's affidavit confirms that both of these conditions were met. The Court finds no reason to doubt the validity or effectiveness of the registered mortgage under the laws of Liberia or Canada. The Claimants have not provided any evidence to the contrary.
