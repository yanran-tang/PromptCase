The case involves an application for judicial review by Master Mugadza a citizen of Zimbabwe of a decision made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Board had determined that Master Mugadza was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The Federal Court found that the Board had applied a higher standard of proof than necessary in evaluating Master Mugadza's Convention refugee status and ordered a new hearing before a different panel of the Board.
