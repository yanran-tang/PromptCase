Mahad Mahdi a citizen of Somalia arrived in Canada in 1995 and claimed Convention Refugee status. In 1997 his claim was rejected by the Refugee Protection Division. In 2007 Mahdi applied for Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) but it was rejected in 2008. Mahdi sought judicial review but the court sided with the PRRA Officer's conclusion that Mahdi failed to establish he was at risk of persecution or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Somalia.
