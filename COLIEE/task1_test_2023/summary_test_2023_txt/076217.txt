This is an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) that the applicants are not Convention refugees. The applicants a Pakistani Shiite Muslim family claimed a well-founded fear of persecution in Pakistan due to political opinion religion and membership in social groups. The CRDD found that their fears were not objectively well-founded citing the removal of the PML government and the lack of evidence to support fear of the SSP. The applicants seek that the decision be set aside and their claims referred back to the CRDD for redetermination.The applicants argue that the Board erred in law by applying too high of a standard of proof for Nafees Akbar Tariq to prove his fear of persecution in Pakistan. They claim that a claimant for Convention refugee status only needs to demonstrate more than a mere possibility of persecution and not beyond a reasonable doubt. The applicants also argue that the CRDD made errors in stating that Tariq has much to fear from certain groups and offer cases where the Board was found to impose too high of a burden of proof. The panel ultimately found that the fears of persecution were not objectively well-founded.
