The case involves an application for judicial review of the decision to refuse the applicant's Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) on the basis that he is bisexual and risks serious harm if returned to Jamaica. The applicant claims that his immigration consultant had him sign blank PRRA forms and did not advise him to gather supporting documents. The Immigration Consultants Regulatory Council of Canada (ICCRC) closed the complaint against the consultant due to a lack of evidence.The case concerns a bisexual Jamaican man who claims he is at risk of harm due to his sexual orientation if he were to return to Jamaica. He cites various incidents of violence against homosexuals in Jamaica including some perpetrated by the police. The manâ€™s pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) application was rejected by an officer who found his evidence insufficient to establish his claim.An applicant's claim for protection based on bisexuality was rejected by an Officer as they found insufficient evidence to establish the risk of harm to the applicant in returning to Jamaica. The applicant contested the decision questioning the Officer's stance on credibility and risk analysis while also suggesting they were denied a fair hearing due to incompetence of representation. The reviewing court used the standard of reasonableness when evaluating the claim as set out in past jurisprudence.The court will assess if the decision-making process was justified transparent and intelligible and if the decision falls within a range of defensible outcomes based on the facts and law. Procedural fairness issues are for the courts to decide and the duty of fairness should be reviewed as a question of law with no deference given. The relevant provisions of the Act include defining what constitutes a Convention refugee and a Person in Need of Protection. A person in Canada subject to a removal order may apply for protection from the Minister. A hearing may be held if prescribed factors indicate it is required.
