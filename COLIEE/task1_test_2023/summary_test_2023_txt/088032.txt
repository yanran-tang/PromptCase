Ange Habonimana and her two children had their claim for refugee protection dismissed by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. Habonimana claims her fear came from a land dispute with ethnic overtones but the member was not satisfied that this was an ethnic dispute. The member also found Habonimana not to be credible and that her story was suspect. The member considered the internal flight alternative and found two suitable places in Burundi.
