Mr Syed Waqas Ali Gilani applied for permanent residence in Canada as a member of the Spouse or Common-law partner in Canada class but his claim was refused due to failure to demonstrate that he cohabits with his sponsor in Canada a requirement of Regulation 124(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations. Evidence suggested that Mr Gilani's marriage was one of convenience and he was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency in 2011. The court dismissed Mr Gilani's application for judicial review.The case involves a dispute over the genuineness of the marriage between the applicant and his sponsor. The officer concluded that the couple was not cohabiting from January 2011 until the time of the applicant's arrest and the applicant lacked basic information about the sponsor's pregnancy and miscarriage. The applicant claims that the decision should be quashed on four grounds while the respondent insists that the officer's decision was reasonable.
