Abbott is seeking an order to prevent Nu-Pharm from obtaining a Notice of Compliance (NOC) from the Minister of National Health and Welfare for terazosin hydrochloride tablets until the expiration of their patent. The parties disputed whether the patent referred to terazosin hydrochloride or terazosin hydrochloride dihydrate. Nu-Pharm submitted a Notice of Allegation that they would not infringe the claims of the patent with their non-infringing process for preparing terazosin hydrochloride dihydrate. The Abbott Patent will expire on July 8 1997 rendering this proceeding moot.A legal case involves a process patent dispute between Abbott Laboratories and Nu-Pharm involving terazosin hydrochloride dihydrate. The dispute relates to whether Nu-Pharm's use of water instead of a lower alcohol and its stirring of the solution at room temperature without external heat constitutes an obvious chemical equivalent and therefore infringes on Abbott's patent. Nu-Pharm argues that the heating of the slurry the addition of concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid and the subsequent heating of the mixture to an elevated temperature are essential elements of Abbott's patent.
