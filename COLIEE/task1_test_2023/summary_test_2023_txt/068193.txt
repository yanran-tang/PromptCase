Eli Lilly and Company and Eli Lilly Canada Inc. have applied for judicial review to quash the Notice of Compliance (NOC) issued to Apotex Inc. by the Minister of Health in 1997 for 150mg and 300mg capsules of nizatidine. This proceeding arises from a dispute between the two companies over patents for nizatidine with Lilly holding an NOC and Apotex seeking ministerial approval to market it. Lilly alleges that the Minister failed to comply with the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations when issuing the NOC to Apotex.Apotex issued a Notice of Allegation (NOA) alleging non-infringement of Eli Lilly's medicine. Lilly failed to prohibit the issuance of an NOC by the Minister and Apotex sought mandamus proceedings to compel the Minister to issue an NOC which was ultimately granted. Lilly sought certiorari to set aside the NOC but the Supreme Court held that Apotex did not infringe Lilly's patents. The case involved several evidentiary issues and motions which were ultimately resolved by the court.
