Uniroyal Ltd. sought to quash a decision by the Registrar of Trademarks granting Sanex Inc.'s trademark application for NO-GRO and to request an extension of time to file a Notice of Opposition. Uniroyal's letter requesting the extension of time was acknowledged but was misplaced and not considered by the Registrar who proceeded to allow the trademark. The court granted a writ of certiorari quashing the Registrar's decision and mandated that the extension of time be referred back to the Registrar for further consideration and opposition proceedings to resume within the time allowed by the Registrar. No costs were ordered.
