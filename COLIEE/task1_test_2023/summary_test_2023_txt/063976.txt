The case involves a married couple Yadvinder Singh Grewal and Amanpreet Kaur Grewal who have a daughter born in 2002 in India. Mr. Grewal is a permanent resident of Canada while Mrs. Grewal's application for permanent residency was refused due to a false marriage certificate. The visa officer also refused to exempt Mrs. Grewal from inadmissibility under section 25 of IRPA.The Canadian Minister of Immigration may grant permanent residency or exemption from certain criteria if it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations or public policy. However permanent residency cannot be granted if the foreign national does not meet the selection criteria of the province. In a specific case the applicant's solicitors requested exemption for compliance and a waiver for a breach of regulations and argued for the best interests of the family and family reunification. The judicial review application questions whether the visa officer considered the best interests of the child and gave too much weight to the misrepresentation.
