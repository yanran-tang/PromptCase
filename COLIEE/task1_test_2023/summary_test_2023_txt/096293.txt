The case of a Bolivian national Ms. Sempertegui who was refused a temporary resident visa to study French in Montreal by a visa officer is reviewed by the Federal Court. The officer gave two reasons for refusal but it was later discovered that there was a lack of attention to detail and there may have been an additional reason which was not based on reasonable inferences drawn from known facts making the decision unreasonable. The court granted judicial review referring the matter to a new officer for redetermination.
