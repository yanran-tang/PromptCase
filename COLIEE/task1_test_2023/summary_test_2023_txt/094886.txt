The case involves an appeal filed by a restaurant owner under section 56 of the Trade-marks Act. The respondent had filed two applications for trademark registration for PIZZAIOLO and design and PIZZAIOLO which were partially upheld by the Registrar. The appellant objected stating that the marks were confusing with their own registered trademark LA PIZZAIOLLE. Both parties provided evidence by affidavit and the case was appealed by the appellant.The Trade-marks Opposition Board and Registrar's delegate allowed in full an opposition to registration of the word mark PIZZAIOLO and partially allowed an opposition to the graphic mark PIZZAIOLO determining that it did not apply to certain wares and services. The Registrar found that the use of the word mark created a likelihood of confusion with LA PIZZAIOLLE but not the graphic mark. The issue of continuous use was also addressed.The Canadian Intellectual Property Office has refused to register the trademark ‘Pizzaïolo’ by Les Restaurants La Pizzaiolle consequent on a challenge by Pizzaïolo Restaurants. The registrar claimed that confounding trademark issues would be evoked by allowing the trademark as other pizza restaurants had already adopted the word in association with their outlets or goods. The judge also stated the name was not unique enough due to its “highly suggestive” character.
