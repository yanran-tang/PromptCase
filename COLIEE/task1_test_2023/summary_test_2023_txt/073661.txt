The applicant sought judicial review of a refugee panel's decision claiming a lack of opportunity to make representations and bias in the panel's decision-making process. The respondent agreed to refer the matter back to a new panel acknowledging non-compliance with required procedures. While the applicant requested a hearing de novo the judge referred the matter to a new panel disagreeing with the respondent's suggestion that the panel only consider evidence already in the record and stating that all evidence from the previous panel should be considered.
