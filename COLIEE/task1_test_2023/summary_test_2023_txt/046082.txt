This case involves an appeal by Apotex Inc. to set aside an order from Prothonotary Aronovitch to provide answers to questions posed by the defendants Merck & Co. Inc. and Merck Frost Canada & Co. The context is an action involving section 8 of the Patented Medicines Notice of Compliance Regulations and arose from a dispute over a compulsory license for an antibiotic norfloxacin. The Supreme Court of Canada had previously set aside a prohibition order against Apotex allowing it to receive a Notice of Compliance for its version of the drug. Apotex seeks remedies for the delay in receiving the notice and loss of market share.Merck and Apotex are in legal battle over the production of norfloxacin. Merck alleges that Apotex had no ability to sell non-infringing norfloxacin and that Novopharm would not have been prepared to supply it. The two parties disagree on the relevance of certain questions ordered by Prothonotary Aronovitch which Apotex refuses to answer. The appropriate standard of review is in question and Aqua-Gem stands for the proposition that a De Novo review is appropriate in certain cases.
