This is a case where the Federal Court in Canada reviewed the rejection of refugee protection to Gyula Kanto Sr. his wife Gyulane Kanto and their son Gyula Kanto Jr. Roma citizens of Hungary. The Board rejected their claim for protection but the Applicants argued that Roma people regularly face discrimination in Hungary and are unable to secure meaningful employment. They alleged to have experienced persecution and violence against the Roma people is largely ignored by police officers. The Court ultimately dismissed their application for judicial review.The Kanto family of Roma ethnicity faced multiple incidents of violence and discrimination in Hungary between 2008 and 2009. After being assaulted and threatened by skinheads and police officers the family fled to Canada and sought refugee protection. However during the hearing of their application a privileged conversation between the Applicants and their former counsel was inadvertently recorded and the family's new counsel argued that their rights had been violated and requested the recusal of the Board member the destruction of the existing audio record and a new hearing. The motion was denied and the Board rejected the family's claim for protection.
