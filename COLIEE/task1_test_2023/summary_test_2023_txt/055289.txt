This is a case in a Canadian Federal Court where an immigration officer refused an application for permanent residency for a family from Afghanistan who claimed to be at risk in their country. The family who are part of the Pashtun ethnic group fled after their two sons were killed during inter-ethnic fighting. However the officer found that the family did not fall within the Convention Refugee Abroad or the Humanitarian-protected Person Abroad classes. The case includes background information about the family's experiences and application process.The case involves a Pakistani couple who was denied Canadian permanent residence due to conflicting information regarding their careers in Afghanistan. The couple argues that the visa officer made errors of law fact and procedural fairness and failed to consider their fear of persecution under the Convention Refugee Abroad Class Country of Asylum Class and gender-related persecution policies. The couple seeks a review of the visa officer's decision under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
