The case involves a 65-year-old Cuban citizen who served as a minister of a Pentecostal Evangelical Church in Havana. He left Cuba in 1990 when he received a valid travel permit that allowed him to be absent from Cuba for thirty days. He claims that he faces a well-founded fear of persecution based on his religious and political beliefs. However the board held that the discrimination and harassment inflicted on him was not sufficiently severe to constitute persecution and the punishment he would face upon return to Cuba for overstaying his exit permit would not amount to persecution. The applicant challenged the board's decision but the court dismissed the application.
