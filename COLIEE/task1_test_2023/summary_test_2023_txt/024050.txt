The case concerns an appeal by an applicant for Canadian citizenship who was refused due to not meeting the residency requirements under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act. The applicant spent a large amount of time outside Canada including 641 days in Taiwan and did not maintain sufficient ties with Canada during these absences. The applicant challenged the Citizenship Judge's decision on three grounds but the Federal Court dismissed the application stating that the Citizenship Judge made no error in his decision.
