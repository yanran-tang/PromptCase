Hamad Ali sought to have his refugee claim reopened after it was declared abandoned by the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Board denied his application citing his failure to submit his Personal Information Form on time and not demonstrating a clear intention to pursue his claim. The court concluded that the Board committed no error and dismissed his application for judicial review.The case is about the requirement of providing written reasons when rejecting a claim in a motion to reopen a refugee case that has been declared abandoned due to the late filing of the Personal Information Form (PIF). The applicant argues that the Board did not fulfill this obligation and breached the principle of procedural fairness while the respondent claims that the Board was not required to provide reasons as it was an interlocutory decision and even if it was required adequate reasons were provided.
