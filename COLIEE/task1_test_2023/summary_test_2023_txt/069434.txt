Action Express Ltd. appealed a decision by adjudicator Dan R. Cameron who awarded truck driver Shelly Lesy seven months of pay after finding that she was unjustly dismissed. Lesy had approached the company in 2000 about getting a raise but received no response until she penned a letter to manager and partner Shane Lincoln in September 2001. The company argues that the decision should be quashed or set aside and referred back to a new adjudicator.A letter from employee Shelly Lesy expressing dissatisfaction with her job was received by her employer Mr. Lincoln who was shocked by its contents as he had previously considered her performance to be outstanding. After a phone conversation and a second letter Mr. Lincoln felt the employment relationship had likely come to an end and that Lesy had resigned. He was concerned about her use of the company's delivery truck and potential negative impact on relations with a major client.The case involves the termination of the Respondent's employment by Action Express Ltd for just cause. The Respondent appealed the termination and it was referred to adjudication. The Adjudicator found that the Respondent was terminated for just cause due to insubordination and that the employer's decision to terminate was appropriate. However he noted that the employer did not provide proper reasons for the termination which could have led to a finding of unfairness.  Overall the Adjudicator upheld the termination but emphasized the importance of following proper termination procedures.
