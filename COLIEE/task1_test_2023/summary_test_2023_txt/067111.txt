Mr. Martineau challenges the legality of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board's negative decision which rejected his claim for protection against the Sri Lankan military and Tamil paramilitary groups. The Court finds its intervention necessary and allows judicial review. The RPD's decision was based on the absence of an objective basis to Martineau's fear since the Sri Lankan civil war ended in May 2009.  However Martineau argues that his fear is well-founded due to his past experiences of harassment beatings and interrogation.The UK Home Office report stated a decrease in extrajudicial killings and human rights violations in Jaffna district and Eastern Sri Lanka. The UNHCR revised its eligibility guidelines claiming those from the northern provinces were no longer in need of international protection. The RPD did not find the applicant in need of protection as he was not individually targeted and held a Sri Lankan passport. The applicant challenges the legality of the RPD's decision on the grounds of a durable change in circumstances and failure to assess the compelling reasons exception. The standard of review is reasonableness.
