Sayyed Mohammad bin Abdullah applied for permanent residence in Canada as a skilled worker but was refused by a visa officer who awarded him an insufficient number of points in assessing his application under the provisions of both the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and its predecessor the Immigration Act. The only issue in the case was the officer’s assessment of Mr. bin Abdullah’s personal suitability under the Immigration Act assessment grid. The court ultimately found that the officer erred in failing to provide any timely reasons supporting her assessment and allowed the application for judicial review.
