The Couchiching First Nation seeks to stop Dr. Daniel Baum from hearing a complaint filed by Aimee Adams under the Canada Labour Code. The Applicant claims that Baum has shown bias by refusing to change the location of the hearing and recuse himself from the case. However the Applicant fails to provide sufficient evidence of irreparable harm and the Judge dismisses the motion for a stay stating that it is an improper attempt to delay the hearing.
