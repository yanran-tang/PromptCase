The case involves an alleged patent infringement related to a safety rail stanchion used on precast concrete walls to prevent workers from falling off the building. The defendant claims that the patent is void and unenforceable due to a misleading application by one of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs seek to strike out a paragraph in the defense and counterclaim that refers to criminal code provisions for false representations and forgery citing lack of jurisdiction and a want of reasonable cause of action. Section 76 of the Patent Act outlines penalties for false representations and entries.The excerpt discusses the potential criminal penalties for false statements or documents in relation to Canadian patent law. The Crown has criminal jurisdiction in patent law and can impose fines or imprisonment for violations. The Federal Courts Act also gives both the Appellate and Trial Divisions criminal jurisdiction. Paragraph 22 of the Defence and Counterclaim is deemed defective in terms of a written accusation in the criminal law sense. Private prosecution may still be open with jurisdictional consent.
