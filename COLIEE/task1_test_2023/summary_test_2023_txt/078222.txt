The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board wherein the applicant a citizen of Guyana was determined to be neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The Board found that the applicant failed to take reasonable steps under the circumstances to seek state protection in Guyana. The applicant argued that the Board erred by conducting a state protection analysis without first assessing his credibility but the court found that the Board did in fact conduct the state protection analysis while accepting that the applicant's allegations were true and that the Board's conclusion was reasonable and should not be disturbed.
