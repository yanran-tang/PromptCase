The applicant sought judicial review of a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division which stated that she was not a Convention refugee within s. 2(1) of the Immigration Act. The applicant's claim was based on fear of persecution from her abusive ex-husband and the case raised issues regarding the assessment of refugee claims based on fear of persecution due to membership in a social group. The court found shortcomings in the tribunal's decision related to the assessment of the applicant's claim but ultimately dismissed the application because the tribunal's conclusion that protection of the applicant can be expected from authorities in Grenada was not unreasonable based on the evidence.
