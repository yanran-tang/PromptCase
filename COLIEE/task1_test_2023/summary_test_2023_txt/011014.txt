e female claimant and her ethnic Russian husband who lived in Bashkir were subjected to persecution and threats from Muslims who imposed their laws on the community. The couple and their intermarried neighbors faced harassment and bodily harm and their house was burned down. The police refused to take action and their children also faced threats and attacks. The claimant was hospitalized due to the stress and continued to receive threatening calls even after her discharge.A couple claimed refugee status after being harassed and robbed by a gang in their home country. The authorities were unable to provide protection as there were no witnesses to identify the perpetrators. The Convention Refugee Determination Division found the couple truthful but refused their refugee status application as they failed to establish an inability to obtain state protection. The main issue was the availability of state protection rather than persecution.
