The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is seeking to strike out a judicial review application from Ken Barlow and the Union of New Brunswick Indians regarding a dispute over 60 lobster traps. The respondents are seeking various orders including an adjournment and an extension of time for filing and serving affidavits. The applicants claim treaty and constitutional rights to fish lobster and trade the product of the fishing. The Mi'kmaq and Maliseet First Nations are represented by the Union of New Brunswick Indians.The case concerns an alleged breach of treaty rights under the 1760 Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Mi'kmaq people which was not filed into the court record. The applicants seek a declaration that the Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans breached Ken Barlow's treaty rights when his lobster traps were seized in 1999. The Ministry denies seizing the traps and the respondents claim the proceedings are a nullity due to defective affidavits filed by the applicants amongst other grounds.A judicial review proceeding related to lobster fishing permits is deemed too complex and requires oral history biological evidence and expert opinions. The proceeding must be converted into a trial of an action and summary hearings are not suitable. Affidavits can only present facts within the personal knowledge of the deponent. The court may extend or abridge a period as per Rule 8 and hearings may be adjourned if deemed necessary. Representative proceedings may be brought by or against any of the parties sharing the same interest.
