The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board's Refugee Protection Division rejecting a claim for refugee protection by two Ukrainian citizens of Israel. The applicants claimed they would face persecution if returned to Israel because they could be considered accomplices of a Palestinian terrorist. The court dismissed the application finding that the panel's decision was reasonable and supported by evidence. The court found no reason to intervene.
