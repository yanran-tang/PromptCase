ibition application is brought. The respondent also argues that the Apotex process was disclosed in its NDS and that the detailed statement of fact for its noninfringement allegation was provided to the applicants. The court will need to make determinations on these preliminary issues before addressing the main issue of whether the applicants have established that the respondent's allegations of noninfringement are not justified.The respondent in a prohibition proceeding regarding a patent dispute argues that a notice of allegation (NDS) is not relevant in such a case and that the patentee simply needs to demonstrate that an allegation is unjustified. The court notes that the issues in the case have been familiar to counsel and finds no merit in the preliminary issues raised by the applicant. The respondent had previously introduced an alternative process in their NDS that had been found to be noninfringing in a previous case.
