The Beaver Lake First Nation impeachment case is seeking an order to amend the Statement of Claim to reflect events arising after it was issued and to deem an action commenced by Statement of Claim to be a judicial review proceeding. Judicial review proceedings must be initiated within 30 days and may only be sought via an application for judicial review under Section 18(3) of the Federal Court Act. The Court does not have the discretion to treat an action as a judicial review proceeding meaning the application to deem the proceedings commenced by the Statement of Claim has been dismissed.
