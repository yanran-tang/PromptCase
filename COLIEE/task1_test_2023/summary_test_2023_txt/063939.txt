MCQ Handling Inc. hired Charles Moulton as a long-distance truck haulage driver and fired him in 2001. Moulton claimed he had been unjustly dismissed and filed a complaint under the Canada Labour Code. In August 2000 an adjudicator found in favour of Moulton and ordered MCQ to reinstate him and pay back wages and benefits. In May 2001 the adjudicator issued a supplementary award on remedies in favour of Moulton for damages of CAD 17421. MCQ sought judicial review to challenge the awards arguing that the Code did not apply to it. The judge dismissed the application citing several reasons including the fact that MCQ did not have the intention to challenge the decision at any relevant time after the award was made and had not offered a reasonable explanation for the delay. Additionally MCQ did not give adequate notice of a constitutional challenge and the court was not in a position to give a definitive answer to the constitutional question raised.
