The case concerns a dispute over the ownership and liability of a dredging ship (M/V Atchafalaya) used by a company called Dragage Verreault for a contract to dredge a channel in the port of Grande-Entrée in the Îles-de-la-Madeleine province of Quebec. The defendants argue that there is no cause of action in rem against the ship as there is no evidence of their personal liability. The case is unedited and contains no summary.In 2008 Dragage Verreault signed a subcontract with B+B Dredging Company for the dredging of a certain amount of material. The subcontract refers to two appendices one containing a quote from B+B and the other containing a personal guarantee of performance from Witt Barlow the sole owner of B+B. The guarantee was required by Verreault as a condition precedent and material inducement to enter into the subcontract.
