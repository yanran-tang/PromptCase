The plaintiff appealed a decision of the Tax Court of Canada which upheld reassessments from the Minister of National Revenue in respect of the plaintiff's farming business losses for the years 1978-1981. The issue was whether the plaintiff was a Class 1 or Class 2 farmer under s. 31(1) of the Income Tax Act. The court applied six criteria and found that the plaintiff's chief source of income during the relevant years was teaching and therefore dismissed the appeal.
