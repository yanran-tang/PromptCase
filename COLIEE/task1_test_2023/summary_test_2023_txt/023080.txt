The Federal Court rejected a Burundian's refugee claim for being persecuted by Senator Petronie Bagwire whom he accuses of using violence to deny him property rights. The judge argued that a property rights claim does not constitute a basis for a refugee protection claim under the United Nations Convention &amp; section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and that Mr. Kenguruka would not face persecution if he abandoned his claim to the property inherited from his parents.
