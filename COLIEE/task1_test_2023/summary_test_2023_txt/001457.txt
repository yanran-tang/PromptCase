This case involves a permanent resident who was issued a deportation order under section 32(2) of the Immigration Act based on a report of having been convicted of two offences under the Narcotics Control Act. The applicant appealed to the Appeal Division which later issued a decision that it had a duty to determine whether it retained jurisdiction over an appellant who received a danger opinion pursuant to section 70(5) of the Act. The Federal Court of Appeal concluded that the Appeal Division does not have the jurisdiction to declare unconstitutional a provision limiting its jurisdiction under the Act.
