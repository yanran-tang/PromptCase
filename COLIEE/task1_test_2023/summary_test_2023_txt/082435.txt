This case is about judicial review of a decision by a visa officer to deny an applicant's permanent residence application because of the medical condition of their son which was deemed likely to cause excessive demands on Canadian health or social services. The main issue before the court is whether the visa officer erred in this determination. Preliminary issues raised include the applicant's entitlement to obtain the medical record from the visa officer and the consistency of certain regulations with the Immigration Act.The case revolves around the release of a medical record that was denied by the Department of Immigration. The court ruled that the medical record is a central part of the judicial review and found it untenable that the record is not part of the visa officer's record. The court also ruled that Dr. Ford's report was properly part of the evidence to be considered upon judicial review.
