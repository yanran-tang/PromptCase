The case involves a Haitian man who applied for Canadian citizenship in 2006 but was denied due to not meeting the residency requirements under Paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act. The citizenship judge found that the man had not centralized his mode of living in Canada despite spending more than two years in the country obtaining a diploma and holding a temporary position in Mali. The man appealed the decision but the court found that the citizenship judge's finding was not unreasonable and dismissed the appeal.
