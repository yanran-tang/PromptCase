This case is an application for judicial review of a decision by the Minister of National Revenue denying relief from interest and penalties for a total amount of $6101.70 as of March 21 2008. The applicant's initial request for relief was partially granted but the balance of interest and penalties remained payable. The applicant made a second request for relief which was denied by the Minister's delegate. The applicant contested the decision but the Federal Court found that the decision was reasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
