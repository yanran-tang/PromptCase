Mr Ping a Canadian citizen has twice applied to sponsor his Chinese wife Ms Zhou for immigration to Canada. Both applications were denied on the basis that their marriage was not genuine but was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Mr Ping seeks judicial review of the decision of the Immigration Appeal Division that dismissed his spousal sponsorship application on the basis of res judicata. The IAD found that the three preconditions for res judicata had been met and no special circumstances existed to warrant exception to the doctrine.The Federal Court has dismissed an appeal by an individual who was attempting to overturn an Immigration Appeal Division ruling. The ruling found that his marriage to a Chinese citizen was not genuine and was entered into for immigration purposes. The individual submitted new evidence but the IAD ruled that this did not overcome the earlier findings. The court rejected the individual's appeal stating that the IAD's decision was reasonable and fell within the acceptable range of outcomes.
