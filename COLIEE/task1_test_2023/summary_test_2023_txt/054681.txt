The case involves the Immigration and Refugee Board's decision to allow the appeal of Ehay Ermeyev against a removal order issued against him. Other members of his family were also issued with the same order. The court granted the discontinuation of charges against all respondents except Ehay who consented to the quashing of the decision. The court also granted costs against the applicant citing the unnecessary trouble and expense the respondents experienced which was caused by the manner in which the litigation was conducted.
