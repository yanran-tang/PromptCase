The principal applicant and his family citizens of Russia sought to set aside a decision of the visa officer who refused their application for permanent residence in Canada. The applicant submitted several grounds of error including issues of fairness law and fact. However the court found that the visa officer did not inappropriately consider the applicant's work experience or education and she reasonably determined that the applicant did not meet the definition of the occupation he claimed he could work in Canada. Additionally the court found that the visa officer did not commit any error in her assessment of the applicant's ability to successfully establish himself in Canada. The court ultimately dismissed the application.
