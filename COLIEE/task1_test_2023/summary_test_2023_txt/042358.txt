The case involves an application for a stay of a removal order to Nigeria scheduled for July 10 2008. The applicant a Nigerian citizen who had previously been rejected as a refugee in Germany filed a claim for refugee protection in Canada. The claim was dismissed and subsequent applications for judicial review spousal sponsorship and a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment hearing were unsuccessful. The applicant argued that he would suffer irreparable harm if removed from Canada due to his injuries preventing him from working and his dependence on compensation from an insurance company which he would lose if removed. The court granted the stay finding that there were serious issues to be examined the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if removed and the balance of convenience favored the applicant.
