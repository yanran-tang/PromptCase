The court is presented with a motion for extending the time to serve an application for leave and judicial review related to the Immigration Act. The motion is brought under s. 82.1(5) “for special reasons” and it is supported by the affidavit of the applicant’s solicitor which is deemed inappropriate. The court concludes that the case lacks any real details of the applicant’s claims and decision-making and the motion is dismissed.
