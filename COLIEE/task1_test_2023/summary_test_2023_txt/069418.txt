Everex System Inc. filed a motion to have Everdata Computer Inc.'s registration of the trademark Everdata struck from the register claiming that it was invalid and did not accurately express or define existing rights. The case centered on whether the trademarks Everex and Everdata were confusing with the court ultimately ruling in favor of Everex System Inc. and ordering that the Everdata trademark be expunged from the register.
