This is a case where Sinnappu Sellathurai a citizen of Sri Lanka was determined by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board to not be a Convention refugee due to credibility issues with his evidence. Sellathurai claims he has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of membership in a particular social group (Tamil men from Northern Sri Lanka) because of harassment and detainment by the LTTE and Sri Lankan army. He seeks an order to refer the matter back to a differently constituted panel for redetermination.The Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board denied a Tamil migrant's request for asylum after finding inconsistencies in his story including discrepancies in his date of birth marital status and number of children. The Board also noted that while the migrant expressed fears of the Sri Lankan army he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. Although he feared the LTTE there was no evidence he had suffered at their hands in the past.
