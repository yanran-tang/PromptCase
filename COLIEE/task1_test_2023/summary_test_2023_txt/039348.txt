An application under s. 41 of the Access to Information Act is seeking a review of a decision by the Information Commissioner. The applicant requested legal accounts cheque requisitions and authorizations related to the Sinclair M. Stevens Commission of Inquiry. While the applicant was provided with about 336 pages of documents portions of the statements of account were expurgated on the basis of solicitor-client privilege. The applicant argues that the narrative portions of the statements of account should not be privileged and should be disclosed.The application of solicitor-client privilege to legal accounts is not clearly defined in common law. The approach taken by the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario is that the content of an account must relate to legal advice and the subject strategy advice or outcome of an investigation. Solicitor-client privilege is a substantive rule that protects confidential communications between solicitor and client and any disclosure of such communications should be resolved in favor of protecting confidentiality.Solicitor-client privilege is a substantive rule of law meant to be construed broadly rather than restrictively. The right to maintain confidentiality should be maintained unless interference is absolutely necessary. Communication between solicitor and client must be shown to have been made in confidence for the purpose of legal advice. Legal accounts and bills of costs are protected by solicitor-client privilege contrary to arguments that it should be construed narrowly in cases involving the Access to Information Act.
