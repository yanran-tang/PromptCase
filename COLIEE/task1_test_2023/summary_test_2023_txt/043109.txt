The defendant Crown has applied for a summary judgment against the plaintiff which has been granted and resulted in the plaintiff's action against the Crown being dismissed. The issue involves an error in a notice of reassessment issued by the defendant to the plaintiff which mentioned the wrong amount in the Balance Unpaid and Refund boxes. The plaintiff claimed he was misled by this misinformation and did not learn of his liability until the Crown demanded payment in 1994. However the court found that there was no real or substantive issue in the plaintiff's claim and that he should have been aware of his liability. The defendant's application for summary judgment was allowed and costs were awarded to the Crown if demanded.
