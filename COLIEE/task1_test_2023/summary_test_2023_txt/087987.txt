The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which dismissed the appeal of the applicant seeking to sponsor her husband for permanent residency in Canada. The question at issue was whether the marriage was genuine or primarily entered into for immigration purposes as defined by section 4 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations. The court found the Board failed to consider relevant evidence and ordered the matter to be redetermined by a newly constituted Board.  No costs were awarded and no serious questions of general importance were certified.
