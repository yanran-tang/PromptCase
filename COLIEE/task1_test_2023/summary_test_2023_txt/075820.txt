Sergeant Tolson Clarke applied for a disability pension due to lumbar disc disease and low back pain which was initially denied but later granted a pension entitlement for his service in the Regular Force. However no entitlement was granted for his service in the Reserve Force. The review and appeal panels determined that his military service partially contributed to the development of his condition but it was not solely due to a volleyball injury sustained while in the military. The decision was upheld in an application for judicial review.The Appeal Board confirmed the decision of the Review Panel regarding the pension entitlement of Sergeant Clarke who had been diagnosed with lumbar disc disease. The Appeal Board recognized that Sergeant Clarke had multiple non-service related back injuries and that the natural progression of the disease must be considered. Sergeant Clarke contested the decision not to grant entitlement for service in the Reserve Force but the Appeal Board determined that his injuries were not caused by a shovelling incident in 1995 as he claimed.
