The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which concluded that the applicant a 30-year-old citizen of Honduras is not a refugee or person in need of protection. The applicant claimed he faced a serious threat to his life from a Honduran gang and provided evidence of two incidents where he was severely beaten and robbed. However the Board found that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground nor did he face a risk of torture if he returned to Honduras.Applicant fled Honduras to Canada in 2007 after being repeatedly threatened and attacked by a gang but his claim for protection was refused by the Canadian Board. The Board stated that his fear was not linked to a Convention ground under Section 96 and that he did not face a personal risk that others in Honduras did not face under Section 97.
