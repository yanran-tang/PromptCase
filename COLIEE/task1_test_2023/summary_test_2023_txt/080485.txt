e plaintiff company had made arrangements. The defendants then proceeded with two alternative applications: to strike out the entire statement of claim or to order the plaintiff to produce certain documents related to the agency agreement with Vet's Moving and Storage Company. The action began with the plaintiff's claim of damages for breach of contract or negligence by the defendants in the transportation of household goods in 1986 but during discovery it was revealed that the plaintiff did not actually own the goods nor the trailer that carried them.The defendants filed a motion to strike the plaintiff's statement of claim arguing that it discloses no reasonable cause of action is scandalous or frivolous may prejudice the trial and is an abuse of the court process. The plaintiff objected to the motion citing confidentiality concerns for a written agency agreement with Vet's Moving and Storage Company. The defendants argued that the plaintiff does not own the goods carried by ship and therefore has no basis for the claim. Both parties prepared affidavits and submitted written submissions and the court considered the arguments before making a decision.
