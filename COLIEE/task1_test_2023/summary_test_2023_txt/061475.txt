Apotex filed an application seeking relief due to the Minister of Health's failure to process its drug submission. Several innovator drug companies and a national association sought to be added as parties or interveners. Bristol-Myers Squibb Canada was added as a party respondent but Apotex limited their consent. A motion by Bristol-Myers and other companies sought to participate fully in the proceedings and the court ruled that a party's participatory rights cannot be limited by the relief sought in an application.he Minister of Health's processing of Apotex's Abbreviated New Drug Submission and not the validity of Bristol-Myers' patents. However the judge ruled that Bristol-Myers is entitled to participate fully in exercising all the rights that accrue to a party in a proceeding and that limiting a party's participatory rights would encourage unnecessary interlocutory motions.
