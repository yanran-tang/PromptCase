This is a judicial review of a decision made by a pre-removal risk assessment officer who found that the applicant a Colombian citizen was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The applicant claimed he was threatened by members of a Colombian guerrilla group and sought refugee protection in Canada. The officer found the applicant lacked subjective and objective basis for his claim. The applicant seeks to set aside the decision and refer the case to a different officer for redetermination.The case involves an applicant from Colombia seeking refugee status in Canada due to his fear of the FARC. The officer handling the case found insufficient evidence to support the applicant's claims and noted that the applicant did not seek assistance from state agencies in Colombia before seeking refuge in Canada. The applicant argues that the officer erred in not allowing an oral hearing failing to provide separate analyses under relevant sections of the law and taking into account irrelevant considerations. The applicant also challenges the officer's conclusion on the well-foundedness of his fear.
