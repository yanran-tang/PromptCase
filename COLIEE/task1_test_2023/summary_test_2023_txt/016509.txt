The case concerns an application for judicial review of a visa officer's decision to refuse a permanent resident visa to an individual under the self-employed person class. The applicant Hong Wei Ding argued that traditional Chinese medicine should be included in the meaning of cultural activity but the court upheld the visa officer's decision that it did not fall within this definition. The court found that the Applicant did not meet the regulatory definition of a self-employed person as required for consideration under the self-employed person class. The application for judicial review was dismissed.
