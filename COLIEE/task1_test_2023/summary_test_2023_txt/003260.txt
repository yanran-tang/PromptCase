Felipe Morales Filigrana and his family sought international protection from Canada under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act due to fears for their safety in Mexico. The Refugee Protection Division dismissed their claim citing issues with credibility and state protection. The family alleged they had been subject to extortion attempts threatening phone calls and an attack but the panel found their claims lacking. The Federal Court reviewed the case and ultimately upheld the original decision finding the evidence did not support the family's allegations.
