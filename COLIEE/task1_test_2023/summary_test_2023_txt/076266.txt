A trader in commodity futures purchased physical quantities of gold and silver bullion on advice from their accountant to claim a tax deduction under the Income Tax Act. They simultaneously sold futures contracts for the same amount resulting in no profit and additional expenses but eliminating exposure to price fluctuations in the market. The court ruled that the bullion did not qualify as inventory in respect of a business carried on by the trader and disallowed the claimed inventory allowance.
