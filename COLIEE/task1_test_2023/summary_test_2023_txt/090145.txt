This case involves a challenge to a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) denying the applicant a citizen of Estonia protection in Canada from persecution by members of the Estonian Nazi Party. The PRRA Officer relied on the CRDD's reasons for refusing the applicant's refugee claim finding him not credible and his evidence of harassment to be inconsistent. The Applicant challenged the PRRA decision but the judicial review was dismissed since he failed to provide new or supplementary evidence and the PRRA process cannot be turned into a second refugee hearing.
