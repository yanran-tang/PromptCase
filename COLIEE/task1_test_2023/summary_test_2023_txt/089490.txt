This is an application for a stay of an immigration adjudication hearing scheduled for March 18 1992 until the applicant's application for leave to commence judicial review is determined. The applicant claims that the adjudicator denied him the opportunity to raise constitutional arguments on his claim to refugee status based on Section 7 of the Charter. The court finds that the jurisdiction of the court to order a stay is not limited by the necessity to apply for leave to seek judicial review but also that a stay is not necessary at this stage as the tribunal's hearing is not concluded and there is no irreparable harm to the applicant.
