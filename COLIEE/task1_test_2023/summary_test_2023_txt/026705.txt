Abbott Laboratories sought judicial review after the Minister of Health refused to list the '620 patent on the Patent Register under the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations for a drug called MERIDIA. The Minister deemed the patent's claim to be different from the approved use of the drug thus not eligible for listing. The application was dismissed.The Canadian Minister of Health refused to list a patent for sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate after it was determined that the uses claimed in the patent hadn't been approved by regulators under the issuance of notice of compliance for the drug product MERIDIA. The patent applicant sought a review of the minister's decision leading to a hearing to determine if the decision was correct or reasonable which included consideration of new evidence from Dr. Lewanczuk.In a judicial review the court can only consider the record that the Minister had before making a decision. Affidavits filed by experts serve this purpose but Dr. Lewanczuk's affidavit which includes his attendance at a meeting with the Minister's representatives falls into a different category. There is no contemporaneous record of what was discussed at the meeting and his conclusions are based on the submissions made by the Applicant's lawyer. Dr. Lewanczuk claims that the approved use of sibutramine includes improving glucose tolerance of humans with pre-type 2 diabetes or type 2 diabetes and that weight management programs improve glucose tolerance.
