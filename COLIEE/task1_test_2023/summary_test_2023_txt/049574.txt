The case revolves around an 80-year-old Iranian citizen who applied for Convention refugee status in Canada with his wife and son after being imprisoned and tortured for ten years in Iran. The Immigration and Refugee Board (Convention Refugee Determination Division) found his claim invalid on the basis of Article 1F(a) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees as the applicant was excluded due to his alleged knowing participation in actions of SAVAK the secret police of Iran that was accused of engaging in crimes against humanity. The applicant challenged the Board's decision for not identifying any international instrument that supported the Article 1F(a) but the court denied his application for judicial review.
