James Wajaras a citizen of Sudan and permanent resident of Canada sought to set aside a decision by the Immigration Refugee Board that found him to be inadmissible to Canada on the ground of serious criminality. The decision was made following Mr. Wajaras committing a serious assault upon a female acquaintance and being sentenced to three years in prison. The Board rejected his argument that it was an abuse of process for the Minister to seek a removal order against him leading to his deportation from Canada. Mr. Wajaras argued that the Minister was obliged to terminate the admissibility process once he was found not to be a danger to the public. However the court rejected this argument and found the process had not been improperly motivated.
