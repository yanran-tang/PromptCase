Youssef Ben Cheikh Brahim Sonia Ghali and their daughter claimed refugee protection in Canada due to persecution in their home country of Tunisia because of their Christianity. Their claim was rejected and they filed for judicial review claiming their request to reopen their file was denied due to a violation of their right to a hearing in French and failure to consider all of the evidence. The court dismissed their application stating that they themselves waived their right to an interpreter and the RPD did not violate their language rights. The court also concluded that the other grounds were not relevant to this case.
