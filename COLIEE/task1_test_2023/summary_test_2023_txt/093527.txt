The applicant a 19-year old citizen of Pakistan claimed Convention refugee status on the basis of membership in a particular social group namely an Ahmadi sympathizer. After being found not to be a Convention refugee a preliminary issue was raised as there was no transcript of the hearing. As a result the court could not properly dispose of the application which led to the application for judicial review being allowed and referred back to a differently constituted panel for redetermination.
