Nelson Duarte sought a judicial review of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness' decision to deny his transfer from a US prison to a Canadian one. The decision was based upon section 10 of the International Transfer of Offenders Act which stipulated that the Minister must consider whether in his opinion the offender would commit a criminal organization offence within the meaning of section 2 of the Criminal Code of Canada. The applicant argued that the minister erred in coming to this conclusion but the court found the decision to be reasonable.
