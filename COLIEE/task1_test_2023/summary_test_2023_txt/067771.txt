The case involves a citizen of Yemen who came to Canada as a permanent resident with a conditional residence visa in the entrepreneur class in 2002. The Immigration and Refugee Board found him inadmissible in 2005 and he appealed that decision. The applicant's appeal was later considered abandoned because of his failure to appear at the hearing and provide his contact information despite having been given several opportunities to do so. The court dismissed the applicant's application for judicial review.
