This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissing the applicant's complaint against HSBC Bank of Canada for alleged discrimination based on race color place of origin and ethnic origin. The applicant claims to have been profiled and made to feel like a criminal by a customer service representative at a branch of the bank. The decision was dismissed due to lack of evidence supporting the allegations.The Applicant was forced to sign a withdrawal transaction document multiple times due to a mismatch in his signature and photo identification. He felt humiliated and embarrassed since he was being watched by customers. The Applicant closed his bank account and filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Act alleging discriminatory treatment based on his race color place of origin and ethnic origin. The Commission appointed an investigator to look into the matter and the Applicant reiterated the allegations. The Respondent provided a reasonably extensive response to the complaint but mediation was declined.A man filed a complaint against HSBC bank for racial profiling claiming he was treated differently due to his race when requesting banking services. An investigation was conducted with the investigator concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim. The man responded accusing the investigator of bias and stating that he had been targeted and stereotyped. The issue of racial profiling violates human dignity and sends a message that the victim is less worthy of respect according to the man.
