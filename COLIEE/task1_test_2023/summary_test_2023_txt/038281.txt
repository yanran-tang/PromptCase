Raoul Andre Burton a former member of the Malvern Crew gang in Toronto sought a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) as he claimed he was at risk in Jamaica due to his former affiliation with the gang and his previous cooperation with the police in a murder trial. The Senior Immigration Officer rejected his application but the Federal Court found the decision was unreasonable as it did not properly assess the risks faced by Mr. Burton in Jamaica. The court also found that material evidence was overlooked and as a consequence the application for judicial review was granted.
