A judicial review was sought to challenge the December 1991 decision of an Immigration Officer who found the applicant inadmissible to Canada because his son suffered from a disability. The issue revolved around whether a writ of certiorari should be issued to quash the decision under Section 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Immigration Act which identifies a class of medically inadmissible persons. The review examined the statutory provisions and administrative process involved in the finding of medical inadmissibility under the act.In 1988 Canadian officials issued a medical opinion stating that a 5-year-old Chinese boy named Qi who was diagnosed with mental retardation was inadmissible to Canada under Section 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Immigration Act due to his need for special education and the potential burden on Canadian resources. The decision was based on a medical profile with coded notations and a narrative component. Qi's father who was a visiting scholar at the University of Victoria challenged the decision in court.
