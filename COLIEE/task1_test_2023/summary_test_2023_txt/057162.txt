The case is an application for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board that the claimant family Israeli citizens who moved to Israel from the former Soviet Union in 1990 and later obtained Palestinian employees for their construction business were not convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The claimants argued they were subject to persecution by Jewish extremists due to their association with providing employment to Palestinian Arabs. The court set aside the decision on the issue of state protection and referred it back to another panel for reconsideration while dismissing the application for judicial review in respect of the claims of the daughters.
