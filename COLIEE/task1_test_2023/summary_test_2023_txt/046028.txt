The case concerns a Pakistani citizen who applied for permanent residency in Canada as a skilled worker but was denied due to falling short of the required points for economic establishment. The applicant raised concerns regarding the visa officer's failure to consider all evidence provide an opportunity to respond and disclose a reasonable apprehension of bias. The court reviewed the decision on the standard of patent unreasonableness stating that courts should not interfere unless procedural fairness has been breached.he applicant argues that the visa officer not stating her concerns to him was a breach of natural justice. 15 The respondent argues that the visa officer did give the applicant an opportunity to address her concerns as she specifically requested proof of paid employment as a financial analyst. 16 The Court finds that the visa officer did provide the applicant with an opportunity to address her concerns by requesting proof of paid employment as a financial analyst. While the applicant may not have been made aware of the specific concerns the visa officer had the request for proof of paid employment was sufficient to enable the applicant to address any concerns the visa officer may have had. Therefore the Court finds that there was no breach of natural justice or procedural fairness in this case.
