The case involves an Indian citizen who applied for permanent residence in Canada for himself and his family supported by an undertaking of assistance from a brother-in-law in Canada. However the visa officer rejected his application stating that he did not meet the immigrant selection criteria. The applicant filed for judicial review but the respondent sought to strike out certain parts of the affidavit filed in support of the application. The court ultimately allowed the application and referred the matter back to the respondent for reconsideration.
