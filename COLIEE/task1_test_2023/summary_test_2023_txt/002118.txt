This is an unedited judicial review case where the Manitoba Association of Native Fire Fighters sought to challenge the decision of adjudicator Allen W. Yost who found that the respondent Vincent Perswain had been unjustly dismissed. The applicant sought to set aside the decision and compensate the respondent. The case involved the termination of Perswain's position as a Fire Safety Officer due to a redundancy declaration by the Board of Directors of MANFF.The case involves the termination of Mr. Perswain's employment with the applicant arguing that it was due to a discontinuance of a function while the respondent denies this. The adjudicator ordered the applicant to pay a sum of money in compensation which the applicant finds to be inordinately high and unjustified. The respondent argues that the evidence does not support the claim of a discontinuance of function.
