This case involves a dispute over a fishing allocation in the North Atlantic with Inter Atlantic Canada Limited entering into an agreement with Dragnets for the use of the allocation. The defendant ship Rio Cuyaguateje owned by Pesquera Cuyagua S.A. was arrested in relation to this dispute. However the court found that the claim underlying the proceedings was not within its jurisdiction invalidating the arrest of the ship and its cargo.Inter Atlantic entered into an agreement with Dragnets in which they held the right of user in a fishing allocation which was later transferred to the defendant ship. The plaintiff claimed that the transfer violated their rights and that all shrimp harvested were subject to their ownership. The court struck out the claim for lack of jurisdiction as the subject matter was the agreement not maritime and shipping issues.
