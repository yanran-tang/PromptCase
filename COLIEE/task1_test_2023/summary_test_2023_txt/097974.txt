An application for judicial review has been filed against a deportation order made by an adjudicator Ms. A. Martens of the Immigration and Refugee Board Adjudication Division against a citizen of the United Kingdom and Ireland. The applicant had joined the Irish National Liberation Army and was detained tortured and sentenced to death by the organization for helping a hostage escape. He sought police protection but was charged with false imprisonment and sentenced to three years' imprisonment. After release he made a claim for Convention refugee status which was later refused and he was deemed to be a person described in s.27(2)(a) and 19(1)(c.1)(i) of the Immigration Act by the adjudicator in 1996.The applicant in this case was convicted of false imprisonment and faced deportation from Canada. The adjudicator determined that the Irish offence of false imprisonment was equivalent to the Canadian offence of forcible confinement and rejected the applicant's argument that his guilty plea was coerced. The applicant also raised Charter arguments but the adjudicator dismissed them as premature.
