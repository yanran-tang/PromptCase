Felix Antonio Osegueda Garcia a permanent resident of Canada applied for permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds but was refused. The Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Officer noted his criminal convictions and found there was insufficient evidence that he had established himself in Canada and that there was no probable ground to believe that he would face a risk to his life if he returned to El Salvador. The Federal Court granted Osegueda Garcia's application for judicial review and ordered the matter to be remitted back for redetermination by a different officer.
