nd hearing began on January 10 2005 but lasted only one day due to the unavailability of an interpreter. The Board then requested that the hearing be postponed to April 2005. The Applicants refused and complained that the delays were unfair and prejudicial to their case. The Court found that there were several instances where the Applicants did not receive a fair hearing due to the Board's scheduling errors and failures to provide necessary accommodations.A hearing took place regarding a claimant's allegation that the processing of their claim was mishandled by the board resulting in unfair treatment. The claimant cites incidents of improper treatment and abusive and sarcastic questioning but the judge finds that there is no link between scheduling difficulties and the manner of questioning. Additionally the judge determines that the questioning does not approach reasonable apprehension of bias and the lack of fairness must be identifiable in terms of negative impacts on the affected person which the claimant has not demonstrated.
