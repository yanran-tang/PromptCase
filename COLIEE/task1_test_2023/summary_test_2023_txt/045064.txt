The court is deliberating on whether non-status Indians and Métis are governed by section 91(24) of the Constitution Act 1867 which grants the Canadian parliament exclusive authority over matters relating to Indians and lands reserved for them. The case involves several parties and witnesses as well as historical and legal analyses leading up to a legal conclusion and a decision on costs.Indigenous groups including Métis and non-status Indians have brought a legal challenge to Canada's federal government over the interpretation of the 1867 Constitution Act. The challenge seeks to have Métis and non-status Indians recognised as 'Indians' within section 91(24) of the Act. The case which could have significant implications for the country's Indigenous peoples has been brought to trial by the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples and several Métis and non-status Indian individuals.
