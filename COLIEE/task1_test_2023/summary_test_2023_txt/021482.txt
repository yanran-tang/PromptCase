The applicant is seeking a stay to her removal to Grenada due to a negative Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) based on her fear of domestic violence which was also the basis for her previous refugee claim. The PRRA was refused on the grounds that there was no new evidence to support a different conclusion from that of the Refugee Protection Division despite evidence showing that domestic violence continues to be a problem in Grenada but that sufficient safeguards exist in Grenada for the applicant that would provide her with adequate protection if required. The applicant has also made a humanitarian and compassionate grounds (H&C) application. The issue is whether the applicant satisfies the tripartite test warranting a stay.The court rejects an applicant's claim that a PRRA (Pre-Removal Risk Assessment) officer failed to consider a 2005 Response to Information Report (RIR) when determining whether she would be safe from domestic violence if returned to Grenada. The court notes that the officer did consider a 2003 RIR and that the 2005 document did not provide any fundamentally new information. The court affirms that a PRRA officer's findings on country conditions are subject to review only if they are perverse capricious or made without regard to the evidence.
