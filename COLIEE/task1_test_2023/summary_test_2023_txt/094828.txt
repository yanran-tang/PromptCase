The applicants Sing Lee and Hon Man Lee applied for a writ of certiorari and mandamus after the Canadian Immigration official refused Sing Lee's application for permanent residence in Canada due to Hon Man Lee's deafness. The issue was how the medical officers assessed Hon Man Lee's condition as a member of an inadmissible class. The medical officer concluded that Hon Man Lee's deafness might cause excessive demands on health or social services. The medical officer requested further information from Hon Man Lee's own doctor and appropriate school authorities.In 1984 the Principal of the Hong Kong Mongkok Lutheran School reported on Lee Hon-man a deaf-mute student who achieved excellent academic progress and showed potential leadership skills. Lee's doctor also reported on his congenital deaf-mutism and deficiency in speech and language development but noted his normal physical development and capability of self-care. Dr. Webster subsequently requested a report from a psychologist to assess Lee's social and intellectual development for entry to Canada.
