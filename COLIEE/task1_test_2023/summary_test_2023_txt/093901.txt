The case involves a judicial review of a disciplinary chairperson's decision to find the applicant guilty of possessing a shank found hidden in his fan during a routine search. The applicant claimed that the shank was already in the fan when he received it but the chairperson rejected his explanation and found him not to be credible. However the court found that the chairperson's verdict was patently unreasonable as it was based on speculation and therefore quashed the decision.
