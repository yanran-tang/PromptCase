The case involves a judicial review of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) which concluded that Mr. Ramesh's mother was medically inadmissible to Canada and that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) factors which would warrant special relief. The case raises three issues including whether the IAD erred by ignoring evidence that Ms. Kharbanda did not have Parkinson's disease and whether the Board failed to weigh the evidence of the Applicant's cultural obligations to his parents. The court finds that the IAD acted reasonably in finding that there was no error in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease but erred in failing to consider the evidence related to the costs that would be incurred by the Canadian public health system.
