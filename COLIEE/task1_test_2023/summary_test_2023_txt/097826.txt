The motion by defendants SCL Bern AG and M.V. SCL Bern seeks to strike out the Statement of Claim and set aside the warrant of arrest issued against the defendant Vessel on the basis that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute which relates to a Shareholders' Agreement between SCL Reederei AG and MPP Carriers Ltd. MPP claims it has an ownership interest in the Vessel by virtue of a 40% ownership stake in SCL Bern and/or a US$5m loan to SCL Bern and SCL Reederei that was secured by way of a mortgage or charge on the Vessel in favour of MPP. No material facts or evidence have been produced to support a claim made under s. 22(2)(c) of the Federal Courts Act.
