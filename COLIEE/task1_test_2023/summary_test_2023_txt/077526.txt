Glaxo Canada Inc. sought to call Dr. Ian W.D. Henderson to testify in open court regarding issues of fact raised by their Notice of Motion which was to be heard on May 27 1987. However the Crown refused to file an affidavit from Henderson and the court dismissed Glaxo's motion due to insufficient evidence and lack of special reason to justify Henderson's testimony.
