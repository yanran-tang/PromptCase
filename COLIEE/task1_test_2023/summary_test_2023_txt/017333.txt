The applicant applied to review and set aside a Visa Officer's refusal of their visa application claiming two errors. The first error concerned the Visa Officer's decision to award zero points for occupational experience due to lack of credibility in the evidence provided. The second error related to the Visa Officer's personal suitability assessment which the court found to be within their discretion. The application was dismissed and the court invited counsel to make any submissions regarding the certification of a question.
