Plamen Kozarov a Canadian citizen and convicted drug dealer serving time in the United States applied to serve the remainder of his sentence in Canada under a treaty between the two countries. However the Canadian Minister denied his application citing lack of ties to Canada. Kozarov appealed arguing that the denial violated his mobility rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.The case involves Mr. Kozarov who was sentenced to imprisonment and deportation after being arrested in Florida for drug-related offences. He then applied for a transfer to Canada under the International Transfer of Offenders Act which was refused by the Minister of Public Safety due to Mr. Kozarov's criminal record and his wife's unclear status in Canada. The case raises questions about the standard of review for discretionary decisions of the Minister and the constitutional implications of the Act.
