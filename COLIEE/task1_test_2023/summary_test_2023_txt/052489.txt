The Minister of Citizenship has appealed a decision made by Citizenship Judge Duguay to approve an application for Canadian citizenship by Mr. Salim on the basis that the decision did not include adequate reasons as required by law. The issue at hand is whether Mr. Salim had satisfied the residency requirements of the Citizenship Act. The court has referred the matter back to the Citizenship Judge for redetermination taking into account the court's reasons or to another judge if the Citizenship Judge is unwilling or unable to act.
