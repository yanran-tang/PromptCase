Members of the media filed applications for a judicial review of a decision made by the President of the Board of Inquiry on investigations of the fire on Her Majesty's Canadian Submarine Chicoutimi which caused death and personal injury. The applicants requested access to the board's sessions but were denied by the President. The court rejected the application for stays or injunctions of the closed-door proceedings ruling that the board was an internal administrative investigation that did not entail a judicial or quasi-judicial function and was reviewable only on the basis of correctness.
