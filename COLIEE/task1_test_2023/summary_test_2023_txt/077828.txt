Jules Cuthbert and his family were denied permanent residence in Canada due to humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The immigration officer refused their application based on outdated data and non-compliance. The case was taken to court for a judicial review with the applicant arguing that the officer should have analyzed the application on its merits and reconsidered it when updated information was received.
