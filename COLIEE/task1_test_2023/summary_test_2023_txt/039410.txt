The case involves a Pakistani family called the Hussains who challenged the decision of Immigration Officer Linda Parker to dismiss their in-Canada application for permanent residence visas on compassionate and humanitarian grounds. The family claimed that the education health services and employment opportunities were lacking in rural Pakistan and that the best interests of their children were not given substantial weight by Parker. However the court dismissed their application for judicial review as the evidence provided was too general and lacked specific details.
