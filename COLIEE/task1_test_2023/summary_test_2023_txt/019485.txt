The case of Fiona Johnstone a Customs Inspector in Toronto who requested accommodation in the form of fixed 12-hour shifts per week due to childcare needs is being reviewed in court. She argued that the policy discriminated against her on the basis of family status as it required her to accept part-time employment in return for obtaining fixed shifts while disabled employees were not required to work part-time when accommodating their medical needs. The Canadian Human Rights Commission initially dismissed her complaint and Ms. Johnstone seeks relief in this application for judicial review.The Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed a complaint by a CBSA border services officer who alleged that the CBSA's policy on fixed shifts indirectly discriminated against her on the basis of family status. The officer Ms. Fiona Johnstone relied on accommodated shift work to provide care for her children. The Commission found that the CBSA policy permitted the officer to work static shifts for up to 34 hours weekly and therefore did not constitute a serious interference with her duty as a parent or have a discriminatory impact on the basis of family status.
