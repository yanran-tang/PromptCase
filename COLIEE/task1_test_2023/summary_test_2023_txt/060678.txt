The Federal Court has no jurisdiction over a cause of action for non-infringement of an industrial design according to a June 23 2009 judgement by Tremblay-Lamer J. The dispute arises from a letter by the defendant's counsel alleging infringement of industrial designs and copyright by the plaintiff. The case was struck down by Prothonotary Lafreni√®re's June 2 2009 order.
