The Federal Court rejected the applicant's request for judicial review of the decision made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which stated that the applicant was neither a refugee nor a person in need of protection. The determinative issue was the existence of an internal flight alternative (IFA) that was available to the applicant in Dhaka and the Board assumed the applicant's allegations to be true.The Board found that the applicant's persecution in Bangladesh was not solely due to his identity but also due to other factors such as control over land. They also considered positive gestures from the ruling party towards the rule of law and freedom of religion but noted ongoing difficulties in protecting fundamental rights. The Board dismissed the argument that the applicant would be at risk throughout the country based on various factors related to his circumstances. The Board found Dakha to be a reasonable IFA for the applicant as internal relocation is generally a viable option in Bangladesh. The issue in this matter is whether the Board's decision was reasonable.
