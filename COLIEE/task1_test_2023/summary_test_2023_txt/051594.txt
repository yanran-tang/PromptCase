The case concerns a challenge to Requirements to Pay and Requirements to Provide Information and Documents issued under the Income Tax Act to third parties. The Crown argues that the case should have been brought as an application for judicial review and seeks to strike out the whole of the statement of claim. The plaintiffs argue that an action is the proper vehicle for their claim and present case law to support this position. The motion to strike out the statement of claim is denied.
