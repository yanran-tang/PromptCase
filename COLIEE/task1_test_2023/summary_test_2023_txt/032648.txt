Compuoffice has requested a stay of proceedings under s. 50(1) of the Federal Court Act concerning Compulife's application for expungement of the registered trademarks COMPUOFFICE and ACROSS THE BOARD under s. 57 of the Trade-marks Act. Compuoffice argues that the infringement action is wider in scope than the expungement proceeding so should address the issue of the validity of the registration of the marks. The court decided not to grant a stay as Compuoffice had failed to demonstrate that continuation of the expungement proceeding would result in such prejudice or injustice.
