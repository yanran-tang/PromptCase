The case involved an Ethiopian woman Ms. Dreta who applied for humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) consideration for Canadian permanent residence. The officer refused her application but the issue was over whether the officer's consideration of the best interests of her child was reasonable. The court found that the officer's decision was not unreasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
