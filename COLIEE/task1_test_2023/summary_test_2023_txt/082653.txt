The case involves the Minister for judicial review challenging a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board to dismiss a request to reconsider and vacate an earlier decision that the respondent is a Convention refugee. The Minister argues that the decision was obtained by fraudulent means or misrepresentation suppression or concealment of material facts. The hearing focused on establishing whether there had been misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact and if so whether any such fact would be likely to vary the determination originally made.Counsel for the Minister attempted to call the respondent as a witness in a tribunal hearing but the respondent objected on the grounds that he was not a compellable witness for the Minister. The tribunal agreed with the respondent's representation and no witnesses were called on behalf of the Minister. Instead the evidence in support of the application was documentary. The presiding member of the tribunal reviewed the evidence and concluded that the Minister's allegations concerning discrepancies in the respondent's information were not supported by the evidence presented.
