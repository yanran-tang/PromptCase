The applicant a Syrian citizen claimed Convention refugee status in Canada citing fear of persecution by Syrian authorities due to his family’s connection with the Muslim Brotherhood. The Tribunal rejected his claim finding his account of detention and torture implausible and his failure to claim refugee status in Greece during his year-long stay there blatantly inconsistent with any well-founded fear of persecution. The court found the Tribunal erred in drawing inferences from the applicant’s sojourn in Greece and allowed the application for judicial review referring the case back to the Immigration and Refugee Board for rehearing and redetermination. No question was certified.
