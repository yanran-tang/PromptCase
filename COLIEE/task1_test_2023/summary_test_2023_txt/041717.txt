This case involves an appeal by Leaf Confections Limited to register the trademark LEAF and design which was refused by the Registrar of Trade Marks due to its similarity with the respondent's trademark TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS and design. The appellant argued that the Registrar erred in law and that LEAF had been used as a registered trademark but the appeal was ultimately dismissed. The decision was based on the substantial use and distinctiveness of the respondent's trademark in relation to snack foods.The Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team is opposing a Canadian confectionery company's attempt to trademark a maple leaf design on its packaging. The team argues that the design will cause confusion among consumers because it is similar to their famous logo. However the confectionery company argues that the maple leaf design is commonly used in Canada and that their product has been marketed under that name since 1963 without any confusion with the hockey team's trademark.
