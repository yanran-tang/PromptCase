Mr. Bernard Joseph's application for judicial review of a decision by an immigration officer that denied his humanitarian and compassionate application for permanent residency from within Canada has been dismissed. Mr. Joseph is a Haitian citizen who fled his country in 2004 due to political persecution. His refugee claim was refused in 2012 and he applied for permanent residency based on H&C grounds which was also refused. The court found no error in the officer's decision and dismissed the application.The officer denied the applicant's request for an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate grounds due to insufficient evidence. The officer found that the applicant had not demonstrated that he was firmly established in Canada and there was insufficient information regarding the applicant's children in Haiti. Moreover the documentation submitted about the applicant's risk factors was general and did not provide sufficient evidence to warrant an exemption.This case involves an application for permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds for a Haitian national in Canada. The application was denied by an immigration officer stating that the applicant did not demonstrate personal risk due to country conditions in Haiti and that his political involvement did not pose a significant threat. The issues in this case include whether the Officer erred in their assessment of evidence and interests of the children and whether evidence of kidnapping is relevant in an H&C analysis. The standard of review for immigration officers is high due to their considerable discretion and breaches of procedural fairness are reviewed on a standard of correctness.
