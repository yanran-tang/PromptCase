The applicant appeals against the decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division stating he is not a Convention refugee based on the finding that he had available to him an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in other parts of Afghanistan. The applicant argues that he had no other safe option and that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in deciding that he was not a person described in s. 2(3) of the Act. The application is allowed and the matter is returned before a differently constituted Board.
