Bao Guo Chen's refugee claim was denied by the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board in 1999. He challenged the decision on the grounds of the quality of interpretation during his hearing. There were multiple instances of indiscernible responses from the interpreter leading to a lack of communication between Chen and the tribunal. The Federal Court of Canada ruled that the problems were of such a nature that they prevented Chen from telling his story and remitted the matter for reconsideration by a differently constituted panel.
