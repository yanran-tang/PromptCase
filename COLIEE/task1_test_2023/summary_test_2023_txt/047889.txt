The defendants object to the jurisdiction of the court in a pilotage services case. The plaintiff claims that the defendants failed to provide pilotage services required by the Act. The court concludes that this case falls under Canadian maritime law and is within its jurisdiction. The defendants argued that the issue was due to a labor dispute but the court finds that the plaintiff is not involved in the dispute.
