The owner of five design registrations the plaintiff has applied for an interlocutory injunction to prevent the defendant from importing and selling a line of plastic tableware called Spotlights that allegedly infringes on the plaintiff's designs. The plaintiff argues that the design registrations were the result of extensive research and marketing efforts and that the sale of the defendant's competing products would cause irreparable harm. However the court ultimately finds that the plaintiff has not made a case for irreparable injury that cannot be compensated in damages and thus dismisses the application for an interlocutory injunction.
