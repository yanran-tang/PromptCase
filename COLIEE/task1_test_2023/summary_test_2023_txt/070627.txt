This is a judicial review of a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision which found that the applicant Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had discriminated against respondent John Stevenson based on his mental disability. The Tribunal ordered CSIS to take remedial measures including compensating Stevenson for legal expenses incurred due to the discrimination. The applicant challenges the compensation for legal expenses in this judicial review application.The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) was ordered to pay the complainant $2000 in compensation for legal costs and issue a letter of apology by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in 2001. CSIS has challenged both decisions and the case has now been brought before the Federal Court of Canada for judicial review on the grounds of jurisdiction and potential Charter violations.
