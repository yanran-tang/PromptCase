The case involves an application for judicial review regarding the refusal of a religious worker permit exemption and temporary resident visa. The applicant a pastor of City Chapel Ministries International in Ghana had been invited to work as an Associate Minister in Toronto from October 1 2007 to November 30 2007. His application was rejected due to doubts that he would leave Canada at the end of his authorized stay as a temporary resident. The offer to work at City Chapel in Toronto had already lapsed at the time of the hearing.The applicant's immigration application was rejected due to concerns over the plausibility of his intention to return to his home country of Ghana after a visit to Canada as well as his economic incentive to seek employment or access social services in Canada. The officer also had doubts about the authenticity of the applicant's bank statement and his claimed earnings in Ghana. The applicant's failure to meet the requirements of the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act led to the question of whether the officer made any reviewable errors in rejecting the submission.
