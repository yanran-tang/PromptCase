Jeanette Scotland was physically and verbally abused by her partner and left Dominica seeking refuge in Canada. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that she subjectively feared for her life but that there was sufficient state protection in Dominica. The case was taken to judicial review and the effectiveness of state protection was questioned. It was found that the standard of review was reasonableness and ultimately the decision of the RPD was upheld with the Court finding that there was ample material to justify the RPD's decision.
