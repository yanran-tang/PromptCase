This case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board in which the applicant a Turkish citizen of Kurdish ethnicity was found not to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The applicant claimed persecution by Sunni Muslim fundamentalists and police due to his ethnicity religion and political opinions. The application raises questions about the reasonableness of the Board's credibility findings and whether the treatment the applicant faced amounted to persecution. The application for judicial review was ultimately dismissed.A Kurdish man who was issued a Turkish passport and a Canadian Temporary Resident Visa before leaving for Canada in 2005 claimed refugee status in Canada citing fear of persecution due to his ethnicity religion and political views. However his claim was rejected by the Refugee Board on the basis that it lacked credibility and was not substantiated by evidence. The Board found inconsistencies in the man's testimony including his failure to report his mistreatment during military serviceÂ and obtaining a passport through bribery as well as delays in claiming refugee status.
