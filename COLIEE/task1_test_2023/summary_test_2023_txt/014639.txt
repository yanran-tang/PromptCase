The plaintiff in a copyright infringement case seeks to require the defendant to answer certain questions on examination for discovery relating to sales and financial information and whether the defendant had been previously sued for design infringement. The defendant argues that the plaintiff must first prove validity of copyright or patent right before discovery on damages. The court rules that full discovery on all elements required to be proved is the general rule and that confidentiality orders are available to protect business and financial information. The defendant must answer the relevant questions requested.
