The applicant sought pension benefits due to an alleged disability from osteoarthritis in both shoulders and loss of hearing in both ears. However his application was rejected by the Veterans Appeal Board due to lack of medical evidence that supported the claim that the disabilities were caused by his military service. The applicant sought review of the decision but the court only focused on the hearing loss portion of the case. The court relied on the facts presented in the intervenor's application record and noted that the medical evidence did not support the applicant's claim.able conditions. The applicant sought disability benefits for various ailments including osteoarthritis hearing loss and tinnitus which he claimed were caused by his service in the military. The Veterans Appeal Board denied his claim citing a lack of evidence supporting a direct link between his conditions and his military service. The applicant argues that the Board erred in its decision-making process and failed to consider relevant evidence and is seeking judicial review of the Board's decision. The court's role is not to determine if the Board's decision is wrong but to determine if the Board committed a reviewable error.
