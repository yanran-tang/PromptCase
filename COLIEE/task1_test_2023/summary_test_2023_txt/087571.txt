The plaintiff H. Smith Packing Corporation seeks to strike out the defence filed by Hub Forwarding Company Incorporated and enter judgment against the defendant for non-compliance with federal court rules and failure to comply with a court order. The defendant had not provided the plaintiff with a list of documents and verification as required by the court. The court had ordered the defendant to provide the documents and appear for Discovery examinations on specific dates but the defendant failed to comply. Madame Justice Reed noted the defendant's pattern of conduct and delay in the litigation. The plaintiff seeks costs on a solicitor/client basis.The case involves an order directing the production of a list of documents with a specific reference made to court rule 448. The defendant's counsel filed a list of documents in November 1990 but did not consult all available documents during discovery in January 1991. There was also a lack of affidavit verifying the list of documents provided which was later rectified in March 1991. The Federal Court Rules relating to discovery and production of documents have since changed with the introduction of Amending Order No. 13 in December 1990.
