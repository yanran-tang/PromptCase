The plaintiff appeals the decision to strike out their statement of claim which the defendants had moved for. The hearing took three days due to a previous decision which stated that a prothonotary's discretion should only be overturned if there was clear error of law or if the decision raised vital questions to the final issue of the case. The plaintiff's standing is at issue in this case.A class action lawsuit has been filed in Manitoba Canada on behalf of all individuals required to file tax returns under section 150 of the countryâ€™s Income Tax Act since 1985. The suit claims the Minister of National Revenue has acted illegally in relation to the taxation of capital gains as highlighted by an audit report by the Auditor General of Canada.The Auditor in Canada has found that certain shares of public companies should not have been considered taxable Canadian property under the Canadian Income Tax Act when ownership moved from Canada to the United States. According to the plaintiff the Attorney General did not respond to letters requesting legal action regarding this issue so the plaintiff is bringing the claim to court. The plaintiff asserts that no confidential or privileged information about any taxpayer is needed to resolve the issue.
