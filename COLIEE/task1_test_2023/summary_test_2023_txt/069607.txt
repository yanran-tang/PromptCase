Royal Bank of Canada has had its application to challenge a decision by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to refer a complaint by employee Meera Bhagwat to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for an inquiry dismissed. The RBC contended that this decision was made in breach of the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness and was otherwise unreasonable. The complaint relates to Bhagwat's allegations of workplace discrimination. The RBC had declined to make its two main witnesses available to the inquiry on the condition that its legal counsel was present which the Commission rejected.
