Inmates at Canadian correctional facilities are able to organize and fund family reintegration days inviting family and friends for a day of festivities. Participation is charged and while prisoners at Warkworth Institution were once able to pay from institutional savings accounts a 2006 decision forced payment to come from current accounts instead. The Chairman of the Inmate Committee Brian Dearnley sought a judicial review of the decision claiming that the Commissioner of the Correctional Service of Canada lacked the authority to prevent using savings accounts for this purpose.
