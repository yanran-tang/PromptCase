The case involves Mohammad Anis Noor's application for permanent residency in Canada under the Federal Skilled Workers Class which was refused by Immigration Program Manager David Manicom. Noor alleges that he followed the visa application kit he downloaded from the internet dated 08-2008 and was not able to comply with the new requirements that were posted on the website in 04-2009. The Canadian High Commission issued a negative decision on Noor's application citing that he did not meet the requirements for permanent residence as a skilled worker.The Applicant for immigration to Canada had 64 out of the required minimum 67 points for the points-based system. He was not awarded 0 points for adaptability as no documents were submitted as evidence of his sister's residency in Canada which was required to obtain the points. After submitting additional proof he requested reconsideration which was ultimately granted but no mention was made of the new documents in the reconsideration decision. The decision was based on the original application and the 04-2009 kit which specified the need for documentation in support of the sister's residency.
