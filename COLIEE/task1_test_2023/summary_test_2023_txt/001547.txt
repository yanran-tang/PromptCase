The case involves an application for judicial review seeking to overturn the decision of the Refugee Division to deny refugee status to two Russian Christian citizens of Israel. The applicants claimed persecution based on religion nationality political opinion and membership in a particular social group. The Refugee Division found that the events experienced by the applicants constituted discrimination rather than persecution and that the state was able to protect its citizens. The applicants argued that the Board erred in law and imposed additional requirements on them. The court upheld the decision of the Refugee Division finding that the circumstances did not constitute a well-founded fear of persecution.
