Pedro Manuel Paz Ospina an auditor from Colombia applied for judicial review of the decision by the Refugee Protection Division of Immigration and Refugee Board that he was not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection. The RPD had relied on the balance of probabilities test instead of the reasonable chance of persecution test. The Federal Court found that the RPD had erred in law and granted the application for judicial review and the matter was to be returned for re-determination by a differently constituted panel.
