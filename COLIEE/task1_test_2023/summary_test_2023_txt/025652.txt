The applicants Abbott seek to prevent the Minister of National Health and Welfare from issuing a Notice of Compliance to Nu-Pharm Inc. for tablets containing terazosin hydrochloride until after Canadian letters patent 1081229 (the Abbott Patent) expire. The drug is an anti-hypertensive agent used to control high blood pressure. The parties dispute whether they refer to terazosin hydrochloride or terazosin hydrochloride dihydrate as the patent list's name is incomplete. Nu-Pharm has disclosed its process for preparing terazosin hydrochloride dihydrate which Abbott disputes infringes upon their patent. The Abbott Patent will expire on July 8 1997 making this summary proceeding moot.Abbott's patent claims a process for manufacturing terazosin hydrochloride dihydrate using a lower alcohol and external heating while Nu-Pharm's process uses water and is carried out at room temperature. The key issue in the case is whether Nu-Pharm's process constitutes an obvious chemical equivalent under claim 6 of Abbott's patent. Nu-Pharm argues that the differences in solvent and temperature make their process non-equivalent while Abbott argues that the changes are obvious and do not warrant a separate patent.
