This is a case for judicial review of a decision to refuse an application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds made by an Iraqi citizen who arrived in Canada in 1999. The applicant had previously been refused refugee protection due to lack of credibility and complicity in crimes against humanity. The officer considered the best interests of the applicant's children his income and the possibility of social assistance and determined that the applicant's removal would not cause unusual and disproportionate hardship. The court found no breach of procedural fairness and no error in the officer's weighing of factors. The application for judicial review was dismissed.
