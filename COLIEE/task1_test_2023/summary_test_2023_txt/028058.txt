John Waterman sought judicial review of a decision by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Loyola Hearn to reject his request to reinstate his groundfish fixed gear license. The license had been frozen in 1993 during a broad adjustment and conservation strategy for the Atlantic groundfish industry. After numerous reviews the applicant's request was denied and he failed to provide sufficient proof of groundfish landings during the freeze period.Mr. Waterman applied for a groundfish license in 1993 but failed to provide the required documentation. His license was frozen and he claimed to have made efforts to inquire about the status of his application which could not be found in DFO records. In 2004 he requested the opportunity to appeal to have his license reinstated. The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans agreed to review his file for an appeal with the Atlantic Fisheries Licence Appeal Board.John Waterman appealed the denial of his groundfish licence by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. The Aquaculture Licence Appeal Board (AFLAB) held two hearings and recommended that the appeal be denied due to the insufficient proof of groundfish landings.
