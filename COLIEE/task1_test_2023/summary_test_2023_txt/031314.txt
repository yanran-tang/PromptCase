The Federal Court Shore finds that on a credibility finding the court does not have the jurisdiction to replace a specialized tribunal unless the result is patently unreasonable. The assessment of credibility is for a trier of fact and since there is no Refugee Appeal Division to fill in that role the void cannot be filled by the court. Specialized tribunals are established for practical reasons to ensure that members of an administrative tribunal entity become a professional cadre of specialists which is no different than a trained cadre of technical safety experts for any specialized industry.This is a judicial review of the Immigration and Refugee Board's decision to deny Mr. Xun Zheng's claim of persecution as a Falun Gong practitioner. The Board has complete jurisdiction to determine the credibility of testimony and assess evidence. The Court cannot transform a judicial review into an appeal or make judgments beyond its expertise. It can only send the matter back to the specialized tribunal if reassessment is required.
