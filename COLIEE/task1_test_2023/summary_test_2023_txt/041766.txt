The applicant filed a New Drug Submission (NDS) with Health Canada for the approval and issuance of a Notice of Compliance (NOC) for their drug but it was rejected due to non-compliance with Food and Drug Regulations. The applicant is seeking judicial review and requests that Health Canada issue an NOC or convene an advisory board to review the NDS. The drug in question (omitted) is widely used in western countries and was available in Canada through Health Canada's Special Access Programme.Hospira attempted to file an NDS instead of an ANDS for a new drug but Health Canada advised they required independent clinical trials. Despite this Hospira submitted an NDS based on literature submissions in October 2006. Health Canada rejected the application and the Board of Review noted that Health Canada had previously made it clear that clinical trials were necessary. Hospira brought a motion to force the Minister to produce documents related to the rejection but the Prothonotary limited production to documents relevant to the rejection decision.
