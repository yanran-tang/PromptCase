This case involves an appeal for judicial review of a decision by the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The applicant's nephew was deleted from his grandmother's application for permanent residence due to doubts about the legality of his adoption. The Board dismissed the appeal stating that it had no jurisdiction because there was no refusal of a member of the family class.The case involves the refusal of an application for landing made by a Canadian citizen to sponsor her nephew who meets the definition of a member of the family class. The issue is whether the Board erred in finding that there had been no refusal of a member of the family class even though the nephew was deleted from the application. The Applicant argues that his deletion amounted to a refusal.
