Dennis Manuge a former member of the Canadian Forces is seeking class action certification in a case concerning the clawback of his disability pension. The Crown argues that the issue at the heart of the case concerns a federal administrative decision that must first undergo judicial review. The defendant also claims that practical concerns for judicial economy and efficiency make an individual judicial review application preferable.Mr. Manuge and approximately 4000 Canadian Forces members are affected by the monthly offset of Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) benefits from their Service Income Security Insurance Plan (SISIP) income. The statement of claim filed by Mr. Manuge alleges that the Article 24 of the SISIP Plan is unlawful and breaches his equality rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The issue at hand is whether this action should be certified as a class proceeding under Federal Court Rule 334.16. The Crown argues that the underlying decision must first be determined by way of judicial review.The claim being made challenges the validity of the decision to reduce SISIP LTD benefits by the amount of Pension Act benefits and whether it was a valid federal administrative decision. The plaintiff must successfully challenge the decision by way of judicial review before grounding an action under s. 17 of the FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. This situation is addressed by the Federal Court of Appeal in a previous case.This text discusses the application of section 18 of the Federal Courts Act in relation to claims of invalid or unlawful acts by government authorities. The court confirms that the time limit for initiating an application for judicial review does not apply in cases where there is no specific decision or order being challenged. However there may still be a requirement to challenge the lawfulness of a policy decision before commencing an action for damages against the Crown.
