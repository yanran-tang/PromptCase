Cleotilde dela Fuente's application to sponsor her husband as her spouse in Canada was rejected due to her failure to disclose her marriage 11 days before obtaining permanent residency. Although she had been forgiven and declared eligible to sponsor her husband a new regulation excluded certain family members which excluded her husband from being sponsored. The court ultimately found that the application should have been processed under the old immigration act and that the spousal relationship was not excluded under the new regulation.
