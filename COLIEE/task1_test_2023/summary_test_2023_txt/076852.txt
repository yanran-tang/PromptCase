The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration appeals a decision by a Citizenship Judge to approve Ms. Fang Wang's citizenship application. The Minister argues that the Judge gave inadequate reasons for the decision and made an error of law. The Court agrees with the Minister and allows the appeal returning the matter for redetermination by another Citizenship Judge. The Court emphasizes that adequate reasons must be given for such decisions and notes that both parties share responsibility for the current form of abbreviated reasons provided to Citizenship Judges. No costs are awarded.
