Justice Teitelbaum granted Apotex Inc. the right to cross-examine on reply affidavits while issuing reasons for doing so. Apotex Inc. subsequently filed a notice of motion requesting reconsideration of the terms of the order and permission to file further evidence in response to applicants' affidavits. Rule 337(5)(b) of the Federal Court Rules was applied as grounds for bringing the present notice of motion before the court. The motion was allowed and Apotex Inc. was permitted to file reply evidence within seven days.
