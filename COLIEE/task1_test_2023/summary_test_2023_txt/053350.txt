The applicant Franklin Antonio Perez filed a refugee claim in Canada after leaving Honduras where he had faced persecution by a gang known as Mara Salvatrucha 13. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board found the applicant not to be a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection under sections 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The court found that the Board did not make a reviewable error in assessing the evidence or applying the law and dismissed Perez's application for judicial review.
