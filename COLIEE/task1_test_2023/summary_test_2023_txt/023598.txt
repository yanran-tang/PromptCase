The case discusses a complaint filed against Canada Post for discrimination on the basis of race and national/ethnic origin. The Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed the complaint finding it unfounded. The procedure followed by the Commission as outlined in the Canadian Human Rights Act is described along with the grounds under which a complaint may be dismissed.Section 40 outlines the process for filing a complaint with the Commission regarding discriminatory practices and if it falls under section 41 no investigation is undertaken. An investigator is designated under section 43 to prepare a report with a recommendation for the Commission who can either dismiss the complaint or refer it to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. In the case discussed before filing his complaint the applicant had an informal discussion with a commission staff member who expressed that she did not believe Canada Post had discriminated against him.The case involves an employee who was terminated from his job at Canada Post and alleges that it was racially motivated. An independent third party upheld the termination but the employee filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The Commission initially recommended not dealing with the complaint but ultimately investigated and found the discrimination allegation to be unfounded. The Commission requested evidence regarding the severity of the penalty imposed on the employee and compared it with other supervisors found guilty of sexual harassment. The employee alleged that Commission staff exceeded their jurisdiction in making a pre-determination about the complaint.
