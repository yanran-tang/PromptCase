The applicant appeals a decision by the Canada Employment Insurance Commission denying a write-off of overpayment of employment insurance benefits on the basis of a false or misleading statement which the applicant denies. The Board of Referees dismissed the notice of violation and the penalty recommending the Commission write off the overpayment. The Commission refused alleging the applicant had omitted particulars of his relationship with the employer on his application form. The court allows the judicial review and directs the Commission to take into account the Board's findings of fact.
