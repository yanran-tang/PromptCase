The case concerns Lieutenant Liebmann's alleged denial of a position in the mid-east during the Gulf war due to his religion and the validity of certain policies of the Canadian Armed Forces. The Deputy Attorney General seeks to strike out portions of the pleadings that relate to the constitutional challenge to the policy CFAO 20-53. Lieutenant Liebmann argues that he has the right to challenge the policy now and seeks an injunction preventing its application. The League for Human Rights of the B'nai Brith Canada may be added either as a plaintiff or an intervenor.The League challenged the constitutional validity of DCDS 9/83 in court by way of motion but the Minister of National Defence successfully moved to strike out the application as it needed to be done by statement of claim at that time. The League was later granted leave to commence an action by way of statement of claim. Counsel for the League argues that a member of the armed forces involved in the current case strengthens their position as a public interest litigant and that the present action challenges a policy that is a continuation of DCDS 9/83.The Ontario Court of Appeal has ruled that the constitutionality of a Canadian military policy prohibiting the use of cannabis by armed forces personnel including medical marijuana patients can be challenged by a veteran before it is applied to his status in a decision that provides hope to others who say the policy infringes on their rights. The military policy in question CFAO 20-53 came under fire last year when army veteran Fabian Henry launched a lawsuit against the government arguing the policy unfairly prevents him from accessing medical marijuana to treat symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.The case discussed pertains to a challenge to new rules regarding costs in which the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence of a constitutional violation. The court emphasized the importance of a factual basis in such challenges and dismissed the appeal. However in the current case the court refused to strike out paragraphs of the plaintiff's statement of claim that put the validity of the policy in question as the plaintiff has not yet had an opportunity to adduce evidence at trial.
