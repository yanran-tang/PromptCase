Mr. Jean Claude Nzayisenga applied for refugee protection claiming a fear for his life due to threats from Mr. Alphonse Buregeya and his family whom he had testified against in a Gacaca court in Rwanda. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected Mr. Nzayisenga's claim finding that he was not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection.
