This case involves a judicial review of a decision by the National Parole Board to deny Fran√ßois Boucher any form of conditional release based on their belief that he was likely to reoffend. Boucher's counsel argued that there were issues of procedural fairness including potential bias and a violation of his right to be heard. Despite having a positive institutional record Boucher had not been released in 29 years due to concerns that he had not adequately addressed the reasons for his crimes. The Appeal Division affirmed the NPB decision leading to a review of the appropriate standard of review for parole board decisions.The case involves four issues: the appropriate standard of review for decisions of the Appeal Division whether the chairperson of the NPB was biased whether the NPB violated procedural fairness and whether the NPB's decision to deny the applicant any type of conditional release was based on their failure to consider or improperly consider pertinent information. The standard of review for findings of fact is patently unreasonable for matters of law is correctness and for questions of mixed fact and law is reasonableness. The test for reasonable apprehension of bias does not ask whether actual bias can be shown but instead whether an informed person would conclude there is a likelihood of bias. The Appeal Division found that there was no reasonable apprehension of bias in this case.
