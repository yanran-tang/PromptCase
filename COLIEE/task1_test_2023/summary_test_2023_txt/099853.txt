The Applicant Niranjan Claude Fabian is seeking to quash a danger opinion made by E.A. Arnott the Minister's Delegate which allows for Fabian's removal from Canada. The decision was made on December 12 2002 citing s. 115(2)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as the Applicant was determined to constitute a danger to the public in Canada. Fabian is believed to be a trained terrorist assassin a leader of a criminal Tamil gang operating in Canada and had previously been convicted of three criminal offenses including conspiracy to commit an assault causing bodily harm.The case of Tharmaratnam Sinnathamby who was deported from Canada in 1998 and deemed a danger to the public is being reviewed by the Canadian Federal Court after he was detained again in 2002. The Minister's Delegate concluded that he would not face persecution torture or unusual punishment if returned to Sri Lanka but Sinnathamby argues he is still at risk of inhumane treatment. The review will consider whether the delegate's decision breached Sinnathamby's rights under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.The case involves a person who has been denied refugee status and faces deportation due to being inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality and violating human or international rights. The applicant has raised several issues including the delegate's failure to consider evidence of a death threat from the LTTE wrongly applying the test for change of circumstances in Sri Lanka ignoring contradictory evidence and basing rehabilitation prospects solely on the length of time the applicant had been free.
