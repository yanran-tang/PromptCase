Deniz Kilic a Turkish citizen sought refugee status in Canada on the grounds of persecution due to his Circassian ethnicity Alevi religion socialist political beliefs and evading conscription in the Turkish military. The Immigration and Refugee Board rejected his claim in 2003 leading Kilic to seek judicial review of the decision. He claimed he would face imprisonment if he was returned to Turkey due to being labeled a draft evader. Post-hearing evidence was allowed by the Board where a notice from the Turkish Ministry of National Defence confirmed Kilic's call-up for recruitment.Mr. Kilic had failed to arrange for his dispatch from conscription in Turkey and was at risk of a serious prison sentence. His request for protection in Canada was denied due to implausible claims and contradictions in his account of events leading to his departure from Turkey. Despite reports of impaired concentration and post-traumatic stress disorder the Board found that he did not have genuine political religious or moral convictions to object to compulsory military service. The applicant argued that the Board failed to evaluate his risk of torture or cruel treatment if returned to Turkey.
