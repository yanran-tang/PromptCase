This case involved multiple applicants seeking permanent residence in Canada all of whom had been refused by visa officers for failing to meet the selection standards set out in the Immigration Regulations. The applicants claimed that the visa officers had not assessed their qualifications and experience fairly and accurately and sought a judicial review. The court found that the visa officers had made an error of law by not assessing the applicants' experience in alternate intended occupations and also breached their duty of fairness by not providing reasons for their decision. The applicant's request for permanent residence was granted and the visa officers were directed to carry out assessments consistent with the Immigration Act and Regulations.
