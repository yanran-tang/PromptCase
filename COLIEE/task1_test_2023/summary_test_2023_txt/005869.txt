Alfred Younis a Christian citizen of Pakistan applied for Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) to avoid persecution and risk to his life at the hands of Islamic fundamentalists and police in Pakistan. However it was rejected and it was found that he did not face any risk of persecution or torture on his return to Pakistan. He argued that he was entitled to an oral hearing but the court found that the absence of a hearing did not violate principles of fundamental justice. Therefore the application for judicial review was dismissed.
