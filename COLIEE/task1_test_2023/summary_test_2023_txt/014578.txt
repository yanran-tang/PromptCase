The case involves Mr. Gordon and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) application for judicial review on the decision of the Board of Inquiry regarding its denial to access its hearings with respect to the casualty concerning the HMCS Chicoutimi. The presiding judge Harrington J. was asked to recuse himself on the basis of real or apprehended bias but he dismissed the motion with costs stating that the applicants failed to prove substantial grounds for the apprehension of bias.
