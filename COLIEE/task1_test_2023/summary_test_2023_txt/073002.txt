The plaintiffs and defendant in a legal case have been unable to reach an agreement on costs and have submitted written submissions to the court. The plaintiffs argue they should be entitled to all of their costs regardless of not being completely successful as they prevailed on five or six issues. The defendant argues that success has been divided and proposes various approaches to awarding costs including limited recovery of costs for the plaintiffs' expert. The court must consider several factors before making a decision on awarding costs. Ultimately the plaintiffs are entitled to their costs throughout to be taxed at the mid-range of column III of Tariff B.
