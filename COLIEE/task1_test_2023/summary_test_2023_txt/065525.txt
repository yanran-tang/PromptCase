The case involves an application for judicial review of a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) Officer's decision that the applicant a citizen of Burkina Faso would not be at risk of persecution or torture if he returned to his home country. The applicant had previously claimed refugee status which was denied by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The PRRA Officer based their decision on evidence available to them and the Federal Court dismissed the application for judicial review finding that there was no conclusive proof of the applicant's risk of persecution or harm if returned to Burkina Faso.
