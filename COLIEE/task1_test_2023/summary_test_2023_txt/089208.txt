A pharmacist applied under the Access to Information Act for disclosure of records containing the names of doctors in Nova Scotia whose prescribing privileges had been revoked or restricted due to concerns over prescribing drugs ethically. The Department of National Health and Welfare refused to release the information as it constituted personal information. The applicant then sought a review of the Department's decision and later applied to the Federal Court. The court determined that while the information was indeed personal information there was no evidence that the public interest clearly outweighed the invasion of privacy and thus the court ordered the application dismissed.
