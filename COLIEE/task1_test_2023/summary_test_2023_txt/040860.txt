t a Mexican citizen was denied a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) application and found to be subject to a valid removal order by an Officer of Citizenship and Immigration Canada. The applicant had been institutionalized under forensic psychiatric care after being found not criminally responsible for a murder he committed in British Columbia in 1991 due to his mental illness. The Review Board had recently permitted his release into the community subject to certain conditions. The PRRA application was submitted in 2004 but was denied in 2005 leading to this application for leave and judicial review.The applicant is seeking to stay his deportation to Mexico arguing that his conditional discharge constitutes a judicial proceeding under section 50(a) of IRPA triggering an automatic stay of deportation. The negative PRRA decision was rendered orally and the applicant alleges that the removal order is not valid. The court will need to consider various factors in a complete s. 50(a) analysis including the potential contravention of a previous order and the rights of Canadian citizens.
