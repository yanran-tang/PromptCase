The defendant's counterclaim to strike a statement of defence was found to be invalid by Justice Reed due to insufficient material facts supporting the plea of patent infringement. The counterclaim was made prematurely and based on speculation and circumvented the court's order denying defendants discovery. The defendant was attempting to introduce a completely new cause of action that would delay trial with no sufficient evidence of an infringement at present. The plaintiff's motion to strike was granted.
