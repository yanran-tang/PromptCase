The defendant is seeking to reverse the Associate Senior Prothonotary’s decision to refuse their motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s action for want of prosecution citing both parties' procrastination. The court rules in favor of the defendant stating that in order to succeed in dismissing an action for want of prosecution the plaintiff's delay must be deemed inexcusable with serious prejudice likely to result which is proved in this case and that the defendant's lack of action does not excuse the plaintiff's delays.
