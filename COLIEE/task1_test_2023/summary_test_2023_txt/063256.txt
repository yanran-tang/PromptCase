This is a judicial review of a decision by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to consider a complaint by David Hynes who claimed he was discriminated against by Cape Breton Development Corporation on grounds of disability. The applicant argues that the Commission's decision breached the principle of procedural fairness and constituted laches causing prejudice to the applicant. The court ultimately dismisses the application to set aside the Commission's decision finding no error in law.In 1992 a mediator recommended the reinstatement of an individual based on certain conditions including their involvement in a rehabilitation program. When it was discovered that the conditions were not met the individual was not reinstated. In 1996 the individual filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging discrimination based on their alcoholism disability. Despite objections from the accused party and submissions from both parties the Commission decided to consider the complaint but did not provide a reason for its decision.
