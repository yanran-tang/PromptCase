The case involves Jose Walter Troya Jimenez a citizen of Ecuador who claims he was threatened by the FARC for not providing information about students in the school he taught. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board denied his refugee claim stating that state protection should have been sought in Ecuador. However the Federal Court ruled that the panel failed to analyze the applicant's credibility and plausibility of his account and that an analysis of subjective fear of persecution should precede an analysis of the availability of state protection. The matter was referred back to the Immigration and Refugee Board to be heard by a different panel.
