Garbo Group Inc. has been selling women’s fashion accessories since 1984 and owns registered trademarks including “Garbo Design” “T.G.I.F. by Garbo” and “Garbo.” In 1992 Harriet Brown & Company Inc. applied to register the “Greta Garbo” trademark for cosmetics toiletries eyeglasses and accessories. Garbo Group opposed but the Trademarks Opposition Board rejected the opposition leading to an appeal in this case. The main question is whether average consumers would be confused and think the “Greta Garbo” goods come from the same source as the Garbo Group’s goods.The case involves two companies Garbo Group and Harriet Brown & Company competing for the use of the word Garbo as a trademark for fashion accessories. The Garbo Group has spent over $1 million on advertising and their founder claims the name is derived from their initials. Harriet Brown & Company intends to use the name Greta Garbo assigned to them by the niece of the legendary actress. The Trade-marks Act will be used in determining whether the marks are confusing or not.The standard of review applicable to the Registrar's decision on the reasonable likelihood of confusion needs to consider pragmatic and functional analysis in contemporary administrative law jurisprudence although the end result may not differ significantly from current court practice. The Trade-marks Act allows for a broad appellate jurisdiction with the admissibility of additional evidence on appeal indicating a standard of review towards the correctness end of the spectrum. However it is not as broad as the right of appeal from other tribunals that require a standard of correctness for factual findings.
