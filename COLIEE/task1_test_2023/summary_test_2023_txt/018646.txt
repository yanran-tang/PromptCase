The case involves an application for judicial review regarding the validity of the refusals of the sponsored applications for permanent residence of the applicant's adopted children. The applicant adopted his brother's two children in India but the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board determined that the adoption did not create a genuine relationship of parent and child and therefore the refusals were valid in law. The decision was upheld and the application for judicial review was dismissed.
