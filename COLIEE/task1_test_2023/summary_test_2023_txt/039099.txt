Ms. Vassel-Samuel appealed a decision to deny sponsorship of her husband Mr. Samuel for permanent residency in Canada due to his inadmissibility under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Immigration Appeal Division rejected the appeal based on Mr. Samuel's previous removal order in 2000 and subsequent false declarations while seeking permanent residency. Mr. Samuel had been awarded a pardon by the National Parole Board in 2009.Mr. Samuel a Jamaican citizen was sponsored by his wife for permanent residency in Canada but was denied due to prior convictions and a domestic assault charge. The Immigration Appeal Division found that while he was doing a fine job raising his son in Jamaica there were no sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations to warrant special relief. The applicant raised six issues including breaches of procedural fairness but the Federal Court found no errors in the Board's decision.
