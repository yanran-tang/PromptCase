Jessie Lusina's employment with Bell Canada was terminated after 31 years and she was offered an enhanced pension package which she turned down. Lusina claims that her termination was due to discrimination based on age and perceived disability but the Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed her complaint in 2003. Lusina seeks judicial review and asks for the decision to be quashed and for the CHRC to investigate her complaint. During negotiations for severance Lusina contacted the CHRC about amending her complaint and she eventually signed a settlement agreement with Bell.Ms. Lusina was offered a settlement by Bell related to her employment without admission of responsibility by either party. Her lawyer wanted the settlement accepted today and believed that a human rights complaint might affect the settlement. Ms. Lusina signed the agreement but then contacted the CHRC the next day to proceed with her complaint. Bell was informed of the complaint on January 11th and by February 28th they requested the withdrawal of the human rights complaint. The mediation was unsuccessful and Bell paid Ms. Lusina her salary and released all claims according to the agreement.In 2001 Ms. Lusina was allegedly forced into early retirement by Bell Canada. She signed a release of claims settlement agreement and later filed a human rights complaint. The CHRC investigated the complaint and requested information from Bell. Bell later alleged that Ms. Lusina had purposely withheld information regarding the complaint during the settlement negotiations. The investigator requested additional information from Bell regarding their separation program.
