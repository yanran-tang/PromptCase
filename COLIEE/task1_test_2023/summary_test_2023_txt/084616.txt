The case involves an Indian refugee who claimed that she was asked to engage in prostitution and work for a drug smuggling company and that she would be killed if she refused. The Immigration and Refugee Board denied her claim stating that state protection was available as India has a parliamentary democracy with an independent judiciary. The applicant seeks judicial review of the decision. The court concludes that the Board did not err in concluding that the applicant had failed to discharge the onus of attempting to access state protection. The application is dismissed.
