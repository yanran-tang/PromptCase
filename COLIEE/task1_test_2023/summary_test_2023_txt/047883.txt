Joyal v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police the applicant is seeking an order to prohibit the RCMP from conducting a service trial for a major service offense under section 25(o) of the RCMP Act. The applicant argues that this charge is a criminal charge and constitutes double jeopardy and that the service charge arises out of the same facts as his prior criminal charges and thus constitutes a chose jug√©e. Counsel also relies on recent case law and argues that the application is a remedy under section 24 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.The court is considering an application for an order of prohibition made by an applicant who is facing charges for disgraceful and immoral conduct as a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The applicant argues that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists due to the actions of the service tribunal while the Crown argues that the application is premature and that the issues raised are constitutional and legal in nature and should be addressed at the service trial of the applicant. The procedures and penalties involved in the disciplinary process are similar to those in criminal trials.
