The case involves a Tamil woman from Sri Lanka who applies for judicial review of the decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which determined she was not a Convention refugee. The Board made adverse findings with respect to the credibility of the applicant's testimony determined that most incidents of harassment were directed against the applicant's family rather than the applicant herself and decided that the applicant had an internal flight alternative open to her in Colombo. The applicant's application for judicial review is ultimately dismissed.
