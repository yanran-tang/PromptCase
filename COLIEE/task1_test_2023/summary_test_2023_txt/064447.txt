This is a judicial review of a decision by a visa officer refusing to issue the applicant a visa for admission to Canada as an entrepreneur immigrant. The CAIPs notes entered into the computer by a visa officer are not admissible as evidence without an affidavit from the visa officer attesting to the truth of their content. The decision under review must be set aside as a significant factor in the visa officer's decision lacked evidentiary basis. The respondent has ten days to propose a question for certification before an order is issued.
