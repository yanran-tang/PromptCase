The case involves the plaintiff Jhanda Singh Gill who applied for permanent residency in Canada under the Last Remaining Family Member program. His application was denied due to his marital status which he disputes. He filed a statement of claim requesting a declaration that he has never been married and his answers to immigration officials were truthful. The defendant the Deputy Attorney General of Canada filed a motion to strike out the statement of claim on the grounds that it is beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The judge granted the application with costs in favor of the defendant while expressing doubt over the immigration officer's refusal to accept a valid decision of an Indian court.
