Mexican citizens Oscar Mario Gamillo Vega Patricia Villa Rodriguez and their minor son filed a refugee claim in Canada in November 2010 citing that they were in danger in their home country due to threats of violence from La Linea a criminal cartel. Their claim was rejected by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board in August 2012 which stated that the risks they faced were generalized and not personalized. Additionally the Board claimed that the family had the option of an internal flight alternative in Mexico City or Campeche. However the Federal Court of Canada determined that the Board failed to analyze the specific risks that the family would face in an internal flight alternative and that the Boardâ€™s decision was inadequate. Consequently the case was sent back to the Board for redetermination by a different member.
