Luis Eduardo Gutierrez and Doris Nelva Da Cunha arrived in Canada in 1991 and claimed to be Convention refugees due to persecution in their home country of Uruguay. The tribunal determined that Gutierrez was excluded from refugee protection due to suspicion that he had committed a crime against humanity. Their lawyers noted that similar issues around the exclusion clause had been considered by previous cases. Gutierrez alleged harassment during his time in the military and being placed in detention multiple times.The case describes the harassment and mistreatment faced by a former police officer in Uruguay for his participation in union activities and opposition to the Impunity Law. He witnessed police brutality while serving as a driver and was threatened and attacked by fellow officers. His home was raided and he was arrested for neglecting his firearm and uniform. The applicant received anonymous death threats several times and he escaped the country with his family's help.The Refugee Division in Canada denied refugee status to a couple from Uruguay in 1991 ruling that the male applicant was an accomplice to crimes against humanity due to his involvement in the transportation of torture victims and therefore not eligible for protection under the 1951 United Nations Convention. The female applicant's claim was also denied as there was no evidence of persecution against her in Uruguay.
