The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board regarding the status of the applicants as Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The applicants argued that the Board erred in failing to consider that the applicant is part of a particular social group and that their extended stay in the United States is not commensurate with a subjective fear of persecution. The Court found that the Board failed to consider the central ground of the applicant's claim and did not properly identify and address the question of fear of gender-based persecution and therefore allowed the application for judicial review.
