This case involves a motion filed by the Minister of Agriculture on behalf of the Queen of Canada requesting an order for the application to be treated as an action. The application filed by the plaintiff sought an injunction restraining the defendant from conducting aerial spraying on non-consenting residents in Vancouver among other relief. The defendant argues that there are many issues of fact and law to be determined and that a factual basis is essential in deciding Charter issues. The court agrees and orders that the application be treated as an action.
