The case involves Kaltouma Ahmat Karambal and an unnamed individual who sought refugee status in Canada due to alleged persecution in Chad. However the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected their claim citing inconsistencies and lack of documentary evidence to support their testimony. The Federal Court upheld the decision stating that it was not patently unreasonable for the panel to draw negative inferences from the lack of information in the evidence presented. The court dismissed the application for judicial review.
