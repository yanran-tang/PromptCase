In 1996 the plaintiff filed a Statement of Claim for the issuance of a Warrant against the ship 'Brussel'. Court orders for a default judgment against the defendants were obtained and the ship was sold at an auction in Halifax for $6313270.00. The plaintiff filed a bill of costs on March 2 2000 to compensate counsel for arranging the appraisement advertisement and sale of the vessel. The defendants objected arguing that the bill of costs includes fees for services rendered to parties other than the plaintiff. The court allowed the plaintiff to recover his solicitor's fees for professional services provided to Holt Cargo Systems Inc. and reduced the bill of costs by 40%.
