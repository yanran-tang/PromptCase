This case involves an application for judicial review made by a Mexican citizen who claimed refugee status in Canada due to threats from criminals. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected his claim finding that his story was not credible and that state protection was available in his home country. The Court upheld the decision finding no breach of procedural fairness or bias on the part of the Board member and dismissing the application for judicial review.
