Kseniya Sargsyan applied for judicial review of a decision from the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) that held that she was neither a Convention Refugee nor a person in need of protection. Sargsyan claimed that her husband had physically abused her in Russia and she fled to Canada. The RPD determined that Sargsyan had an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) available to her in two Russian cities and the decision was found to be reasonable by the court.
