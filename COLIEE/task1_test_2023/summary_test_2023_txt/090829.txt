t the respondent but did not include investigation reports or responses from CPC. The applicant then filed a motion seeking the Commissioner to provide investigation reports and responses from CPC for the complaint files. However the motion was dismissed along with the applicant's motions seeking advance costs and the respondent's motion seeking security for costs. The applicant had filed three applications against the respondent for alleged failure to comply with linguistic obligations towards employees and the public seeking a total of $70000 in damages and other remedies. The Commissioner is not a party to these applications but has received copies of the documents filed.The case involves a complaint filed by the applicant regarding a breach of the Official Languages Act by the Canada Post Corporation (CPC). The applicant requested access to information about similar complaints against the CPC but the request was refused by the Commissioner based on the Access to Information Act. The applicant sought to compel the Commissioner to provide the requested documents but the motion was dismissed by the Prothonotary as there was no provision to do so.An appeal was made to determine whether the Commissioner of Official Languages has a duty to disclose documents and testimony in connection to a case. The Prothonotary did not find any mechanism to compel the production of these materials and deemed the information already provided was sufficient. The appeal raised three questions and the standard of review for discretionary orders of prothonotaries was discussed. The decision was ultimately upheld finding no duty for the Commissioner to disclose the requested materials. Rule 317(1) of the Federal Courts Rules was also discussed.
