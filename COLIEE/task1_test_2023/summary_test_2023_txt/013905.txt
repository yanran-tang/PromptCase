Eli Lilly and Company and Eli Lilly Canada are seeking an order to prohibit the Minister of National Health and Welfare from issuing a Notice of Compliance to Novopharm for 20mg capsules of fluoxetine hydrochloride until the expiration of Canadian Letters Patent 1051034 on March 19 1996. The key issue surrounding this case involves determining whether Novopharm's allegation that its supplier doesn't use the same process as Lilly for producing the drug PROZAC is justified.The case involved a dispute between Lilly and Novopharm over patent protection for fluoxetine hydrochloride the active ingredient in the antidepressant Prozac. The patent covered both process claims and product-by-process claims providing protection for the drug when prepared by a specific process or its chemical equivalents. The key issue in the case was whether Novopharm's process for producing the drug infringes on Lilly's patent which involved a different process. Expert witnesses provided conflicting evidence and the court needed to evaluate their testimony to make a determination.The Lilly Patent outlines a six-step process for the synthesis of fluoxetine hydrochloride but only the last three steps are claimed in the patent. The Fermion Process used by the respondents' supplier involves a five-step synthetic pathway including a benzyl protecting group and different sequences of reduction and deprotection steps. The major differences between the two processes are outlined in Dr. Fallis' affidavit.This legal case involves Novopharm's attempt to produce a generic version of the antidepressant fluoxetine which is protected by Eli Lilly's patent. The disputed issue is whether Novopharm's production process violates Eli Lilly's patent. The court considers the steps involved in both processes and the legislative framework provided in the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations and the Food and Drug Regulations.
