Blessing Ngozi Ottie came to Canada from Nigeria in 2003 under a study visa but claimed refugee protection in 2003 shortly before the completion of her educational program. Her claim was based on allegations of an arranged marriage obligation to submit to female genital mutilation (FGM) and surrendering her child to an out-of-wedlock. The Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed her claim for protection in January 2006 and the case was later remitted to a differently constituted Board for a redetermination on the merits.
