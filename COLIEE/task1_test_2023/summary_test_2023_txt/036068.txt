This is a judicial review of a decision by the Canadian Immigration Officer to deny the applicant permanent residency under the Canadian Experience Class. The Officer found that the applicant did not meet the skilled work requirement and had not demonstrated that she had acquired a minimum of one year of qualifying full-time employment. The applicant claimed breach of procedural fairness but the court found that the Officer had not breached procedural fairness and that the decision was reasonable based on the evidence before her. Therefore the application was dismissed.
