The application for judicial review seeks to quash a Notice to Dispose issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency requiring Halifax Regional Municipality to dispose of trees suspected of being infested with the Brown Spruce Longhorn Beetle in Point Pleasant Park. The notice did not specify a particular number of trees to be destroyed but estimates suggested it could affect approximately 10000 trees. The application was filed by Friends of Point Pleasant Park an incorporated society and residents who have enjoyed access to the park.The applicants filed an application for judicial review and an interlocutory injunction to prevent the Canadian Food Inspection Agency from cutting down trees in Point Pleasant Park. The injunction was granted until the judicial review was heard and a motion to dissolve the injunction was later dismissed by the judge due to the applicants' efforts to move the judicial review forward. An application for leave to intervene by the Nova Scotia Forest Products Association was also dismissed.The case concerns the Friends of Point Pleasant Park's challenge to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) Notice to Dispose of trees in the park due to concerns over the spread of a plant pest the brown spruce longhorn beetle. The court addressed four issues raised by the applicants including whether CFIA breached procedural fairness and whether it complied with legislative provisions. Two preliminary issues were also raised by the respondent including that the Notice to Dispose did not specify any number of trees to be cut and that one of the applicants' issues was not within the terms of the originating application.
