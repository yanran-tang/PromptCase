Édutile a small business that sells price guides for used cars and trucks has brought an action for copyright infringement against the Association a nonprofit association for the protection of vehicle consumers alleging that its guide reproduced a substantial part of Édutile's works. The court held that Édutile's work did not constitute an original literary work entitled to Copyright Act protection and that even if it did the Association's guide did not reproduce a substantial part of it.
