The case involves Mr. Valdes a homosexual man from Mexico who alleges he is at risk in his country. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board concluded that state protection was available and that Mr. Valdes had a viable internal flight alternative in Mexico City. The court found no basis for the applicant's argument that the RPD had erred in its determination and dismissed the application for judicial review.
