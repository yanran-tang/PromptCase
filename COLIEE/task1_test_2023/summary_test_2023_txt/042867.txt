The case concerns an application for leave to challenge a decision of the Canadian Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) and the filing of new evidence in reply. The applicant filed an affidavit stating that the Board relied on its own notes rather than an official recording and a transcript of the hearing was attached. The respondent objected to the affidavit and transcript being filed and argued that it was in breach of the Federal Court Immigration Rules. The court granted leave to file the transcript and directed the respondent to file any further representations within two weeks.
