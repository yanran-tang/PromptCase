The case involves Semiramiss Ziaei an Iranian nurse/medical technologist who was denied a permanent resident visa by a Visa Officer at the Canadian Embassy in Damascus Syria. Ziaei's husband's visa application was also based substantially on hers. Ziaei argued that there was a breach of procedural fairness in failing to provide detailed reasons for the denial and that the points assessment was incorrect. However the court found no denial of natural justice or error of fact and law justifying the court's interference with the Visa Officer's decision. The application for judicial review was dismissed.
