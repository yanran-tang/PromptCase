The case concerns a Chinese seaman Mr. Zhang who arrived in North Vancouver in 2005 and applied for refugee status in 2007. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) granted him refugee status but the court overturned the decision due to insufficient reasoning by the RPD. The court ordered that the application be returned to the RPD for reconsideration and re-determination by a differently constituted panel. The court raised several questions about the evidence presented and the RPD's analysis of that evidence.
