A visa officer denied an Iranian family's permanent residency application to Canada due to the daughter's multiple sclerosis which the officer deemed would cause an excessive demand on health services. The family argued that they could cover the cost of the daughter's medication and offered to hold the Quebec Government harmless but the government's appointed doctor maintained that the daughter's condition could cause an excessive demand. The court found that the visa officer did not properly consider the family's ability and willingness to pay for medication and breached procedural fairness. The Minister has until January 26 2020 to propose a certified question for appeal.
