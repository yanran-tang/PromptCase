Two copyright infringement cases were brought against a defendant accused of photocopying legal materials owned by the plaintiffs that were held in the defendant's Great Library at Osgoode Hall in Toronto. The defendant's photocopying policies were governed by the Access to the Law Policy adopted in Convocation on the 28th of January 1996. The case involved an analysis of the subsistence and ownership of copyright infringement and defences such as fair dealing and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The plaintiffs and defendant sought different reliefs.The case involves a dispute over photocopying practices at the Great Library in Canada. The library has a policy on photocopying which is intended for court tribunal and government proceedings. The policy states that individuals must identify themselves and their purpose when making a request and that discretion must be used regarding the amount of copying. The library charges a fee for this service to cover its costs. The case heard evidence regarding policies and practices of the plaintiff Canada Law Book Inc. and the defendant's counterclaims sought declarations regarding self-service photocopying. Notices of Constitutional Question were served but in the end no submissions went to the constitutional validity of an Act of Parliament or of the legislature of any province or of a regulation thereunder.Canadian publishers of law textbooks and other legal publications filed a lawsuit against the Law Society of Upper Canada regarding the latter's copyright infringement. The plaintiffs argued that the Law Society unlawfully published their publications without proper authorization or compensation. However the case was not resolved as the plaintiffs' motion was not dealt with.Before 1996 the Law Society of Ontario oversaw the Great Library at Osgoode Hall which serves members of the Ontario Bar and judiciary and disseminated judicial decisions through the distribution of the Ontario Reports to its members. It is a non-profit corporation which has governed the legal profession of what is now the province of Ontario since 1822 and has a statutory obligation to disseminate judicial decisions. The plaintiffs' sales representatives have attended the Great Library to sell their products and it became a practice since the late 1970s/early 1980s to make copies of reported judicial decisions including those published by the plaintiffs to give to judges and other parties in judicial proceedings. The defendant does not directly monitor the use of the free-standing photocopy machines in the Great Library other than by posting a sign above them stating that the copyright law of Canada governs their use.The defendant the Great Library provides copies of materials including those published by the three plaintiffs. Prior to January 1996 photocopying request forms did not require the requester to state the purpose of the photocopying but since then the Access to the Law Policy requires staff to ask for the purpose. The Great Library charges a lower rate for requesters outside of Toronto and mainly provides copies for individual reported judicial decisions. A government order allows reproduction of federal law without charge or permission as long as due diligence is exercised in ensuring accuracy and it is not represented as an official version.The case pertains to the unauthorized reproduction of judicial decisions by a Canadian legal publisher without permission from the courts or the Canadian government. The plaintiffs argue that the defendant's actions violated copyright laws and caused economic harm to the rightful owners of the publications. The defendant argues that their actions fall under fair dealing and that the government's open court principle allows for the reproduction of court decisions. The court must determine if the defendant's reproductions were done in good faith and if fair dealing applies in this case.The defendant copied and delivered portions of legal publications to lawyers and others without permission from the publishers. The plaintiff publishers had notices prohibiting reproduction of their publications but the defendant did not ask the purpose of the requests. Since 1993 the plaintiff publishers have offered copies of their judicial decisions for a fee. A notice later appeared in one publisher's publications allowing reproduction for certain legal proceedings.The plaintiffs seek permanent injunctions delivery up for destruction of infringing copies of literary works an accounting of profits and solicitor and client costs among other things in a copyright infringement case against the defendant for its custom photocopying service. The plaintiffs later abandoned their claims to damages or profits and revised their claims for relief to be more focused.The plaintiffs dropped claims for damages and delivery up of infringing materials while adding claims for declarations regarding copyright subsistence ownership and infringement in specific publications or portions. They also added claims for injunctive relief related to these publications. The revised claims seek a declaration of copyright subsistence and ownership for various works as well as a declaration that the defendant infringed on copyright by making copies of those works.The plaintiffs are suing the defendant for copyright infringement for making photocopies and distributing copyrighted materials without their consent. The defendant counters by seeking a declaration that their actions constitute fair dealing for research or review purposes and do not infringe on the plaintiffs' copyright. The defendant also seeks to continue providing this service to members and employees for a fee that approximates their cost.The lawsuit revolves around whether copyright infringement has occurred when a publisher photocopies and resells parts of legal documents including reported judicial decisions and annotated statutory instruments. The plaintiffs claim they own copyright in these works while the defendant argues that they are part of the public domain and subject to fair dealing. The court must determine the ownership of copyright and whether infringement has occurred.The court case involves issues of copyright infringement particularly related to photocopying and reproduction of works. The plaintiffs raised questions about whether the defendant's actions constituted infringement and anticipated defences related to substantial part taken overriding public interest and fair dealing exemptions. The defendant raised issues such as whether they had an implied license to make copies and whether permanent injunctive relief was appropriate. The plaintiffs presented evidence from nine witnesses and filed 65 exhibits.Ms. Eberts a Bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada and Chair of the Libraries and Reporting Committee was involved in the provision of a custom photocopy service for members of the law profession since 1960. The plaintiffs included witnesses such as Professor Bruce Dunlop and Ms. Geralyn Christmas who testified on legal publishing and copyright issues. Roslyn J. Levine Q.C. testified under subpoena. Andrew Martin was Executive Director of the Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency. Professor Bruce Feldthusen also testified.The defendant in the case called twelve witnesses and presented forty exhibits including extracts from the examination for discovery of key witnesses. The witnesses called included legal experts judges and librarians who provided insights into the issues at hand. The defendant's evidence aimed to counter the plaintiffs' claims and demonstrate that the actions taken were not illegal.Various individuals were involved in the proceedings including Ms. Jacinthe Boudreau Mr. Stephen Cole Mr. Silvano Carlesso Mr. Simon Chester Ms. Leslie Cameron The Honourable John D. Arnup and Mr. Hugh Pattison. Professor Glenn a member of the Bars of British Columbia and Québec and a Professor of Law at McGill University also provided an expert affidavit for the defendant. The case involved assessing the profitability of the custom photocopy service provided by the Great Library of the Law Society of Upper Canada during a specific period.Testimony and exhibits affirmed the agreed statement of facts. Plaintiff's testimony focused on the process of selecting editing and publishing judicial decisions as well as the development and publication of annotated volumes summaries indexes and textbooks. Executive Director of CANCOPY testified about the establishment and objectives of the organization to license photocopying and collect fees to distribute to writers and publishers. The affidavit of Professor Glenn an expert on comparative law was not given weight in the court's analysis and conclusions.  CANCOPY representing Canadian publishing companies has lost a copyright case alleging that the Great Library at Osgoode Hall infringed copyright by reproducing content from its collection. The decision rests on a fair dealing exception in copyright law for research and private study. The custom photocopy service was found to operate at a loss and used by judges and lawyers rather than members of the general public.
The case involves copyright infringement of reported judicial decisions by the defendant. The plaintiffs must prove the subsistence and ownership of copyright of the works and that the defendant's actions constitute infringement. The number of requests for access to these decisions has decreased since the litigation began in 1993. The plaintiffs are seeking a declaration and injunction against the defendant's actions. The case involves provisions of the Copyright Act and the parties' positions on the matter.
