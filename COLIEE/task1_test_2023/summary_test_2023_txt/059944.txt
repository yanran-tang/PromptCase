The applicant a Nigerian journalist claimed Convention refugee status in Canada based on a well-founded fear of persecution from the government of Nigeria due to his political opinion and membership in a particular social group. However the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board determined the applicant not to be a Convention refugee citing inconsistencies in his testimony and failure to claim refugee status earlier. The Federal Court of Canada upheld the decision and dismissed the application.
