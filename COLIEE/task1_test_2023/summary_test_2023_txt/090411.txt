A 58-year-old Canadian veteran of the Armed Forces has been granted a judicial review after the Veterans Review and Appeal Board refused to grant him a pension. Richard Carnegie is seeking the review due to an adverse decision regarding his condition of alopecia universalis which he claims was attributable to or incurred during special duty service in Cyprus. The case is being reviewed under section 21(1) of the Pension Act which governs pension entitlement and the decision will be remitted back to the Board for reconsideration.
