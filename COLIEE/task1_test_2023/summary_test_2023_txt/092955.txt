This legal case concerns an appeal and cross-appeal with regards to the obtaining of evidence in a patent infringement and validity case. The court upheld most of the Prothonotary's decisions except for a few where solicitor-client privilege was not established and where it was necessary to clarify the Prothonotary's order. The court determined that deference should be shown to their decisions on matters of relevance just as it would be shown on other preliminary pre-trial matters. The outcome of the appeals was not expected to have a significant effect on the case and no costs were awarded.
