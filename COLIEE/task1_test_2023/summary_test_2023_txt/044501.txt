Generic drug manufacturers Novopharm Limited and Apotex Inc. applied to be added as parties respondent or alternatively as intervenors in three judicial review applications by pharmaceutical companies including Merck and Glaxo Wellcome concerning the patent list for drugs. The issue at hand is whether the Minister of National Health and Welfare has the power to remove process patents from patent lists. Novopharm and Apotex were granted standing as intervenors on the grounds that they have legal interests which will be affected by the Minister's decision.
