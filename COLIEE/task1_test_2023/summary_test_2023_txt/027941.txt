Beatriz Olarte Torres and her minor daughter Yessica Rubi Vargas Olarte claimed refugee protection in Canada after fleeing Mexico where Beatriz was sexually assaulted by policemen and received no protection from the authorities. In March 2004 the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board found the applicants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection as Mexico is a large and democratic country with an internal flight alternative available to them. The Federal Court found the Board's decision was not unreasonable and dismissed the applicants' application for judicial review.
