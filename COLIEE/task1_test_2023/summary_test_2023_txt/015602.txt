The case concerns four statements of claim filed by the Louis Bull Band and Montana Band with individual plaintiffs suing on behalf of all members of the respective bands. The defendant's motions raise issues regarding the similarity of the later actions to the actions originally filed in 1993. The actions seek declarations and damages in relation to royalties and revenues earned from oil and gas production on the Pigeon Lake Reserve in which each of the bands claims it is entitled to 25% of the total royalties and revenues held or paid by the defendant for or to the four bands entitled to share in those royalties.The plaintiffs are claiming that the defendant breached trust and fiduciary obligations in relation to the Pigeon Lake Reserve and that they are entitled to 25% of all profits royalties and damages resulting from mismanagement. The defendant is seeking to strike out or stay the statement of claim while the plaintiffs argue that the 1993 and 1999 actions are different and should not be joined. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for a one-quarter share of the Royalty Trust Funds already paid out and yet to be paid out by the Crown to the four Bands having a beneficial interest in the Pigeon Lake Reserve.
