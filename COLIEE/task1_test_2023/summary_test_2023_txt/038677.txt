Estardai Beharry and her two children fled to Canada after a brutal home invasion and sought refugee protection. Their application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds was rejected by a PRRA Officer but a Federal Court judge determined that the decision was unreasonable due to the hardship the family would face if they were forced to return to Guyana. The judge ordered the matter to be remitted to a different officer for re-determination.
