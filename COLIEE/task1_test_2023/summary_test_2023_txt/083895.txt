The case involves Mr. and Mrs. Ortiz Juarez whose refugee application was denied by the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) citing lack of credibility and failure to displace the presumption of state protection. The IRB found the couple's evidence to be uncorroborated and there was no evidence of state protection inefficiency in Mexico which is a functioning democracy. The judge upheld the IRB's decision and rejected new counsel's attempt to blame former counsel for the various omissions from Mrs. Ortiz Juarez's information form.
