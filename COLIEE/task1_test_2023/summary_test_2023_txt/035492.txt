This is a case of judicial review of a decision made by an adjudicator who dismissed the applicant's objection to the admissibility of the respondent's complaint. The respondent was a temporary employee covered by a collective agreement with the applicant. The adjudicator's decision was that the complaint was admissible but the applicant disagreed and sought judicial review. The court found that the adjudicator erred in law and set aside his decision. The matter was returned to the same adjudicator for him to rule on jurisdiction in accordance with the court's reasons.
