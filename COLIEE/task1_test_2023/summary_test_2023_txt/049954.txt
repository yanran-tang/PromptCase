This article describes the judicial review application by Mr. Azizur Rahman against the Immigration Appeal Division's decision to deny his sponsorship appeal for his wife Sultana Akter. The IAD dismissed the appeal without an oral hearing citing res judicata. This decision was based on the finding that the Applicant failed to establish any special circumstance that would warrant the non-application of the doctrine. The article provides background information on the previous sponsorship applications and the reasons for their rejection.The case involves an appeal by an applicant whose spousal sponsorship application was denied for being fraudulent. The Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) dismissed the appeal by applying the doctrine of res judicata which the applicant is challenging in court. The appropriate standard of review for the IAD's res judicata analysis is under scrutiny as well as whether the IAD erred in applying the doctrine and whether they should have granted an oral hearing.
