Knirps International GmbH has lost its appeal against the decision of the Trademarks Opposition Board which had rejected its opposition to the registration by S.R.O. Apparels of the trademark M'otto Red Dot that was to be used for sportswear. Knirps had argued that the mark would create confusion but the Board determined that the mark was not distinctive and did not infringe on Knirps' trademarks for umbrellas. The appeal court upheld the Board's decision.
