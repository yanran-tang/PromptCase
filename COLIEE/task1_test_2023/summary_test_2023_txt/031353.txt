A Canadian court has begun hearing arguments from Merck to strike a motion lodged by Apotex claiming damages over an eleven-month delay in acquiring marketing approval for the drug Apo-Lovastatin. The decision marks the latest development in a long-running legal dispute between the two companies over whether the drug is made using a process that infringes Merckâ€™s 380 Patent. Merck has counterclaimed that Apotex is not entitled to compensation due to the alleged patent infringement.Apotex has filed a motion against Merck for their allegations of infringement of the 380 patent. The company claims a lack of reasonable defense in the infringement patent action and calls the counterclaim an abuse of the court's process. Apotex seeks damages from Merck for keeping them off the market from April 26 1996 until March 26 1997. Merck seeks a declaration that plaintiffs infringed on the patent in question and requests to set-off the damages claimed by Apotex.Apotex argues that patent infringement is irrelevant to a section 8 action and that the first person is liable for any losses suffered by the second person without proof of fault or infringement. The object of section 6 proceedings is solely to prohibit the issuance of a Notice of Compliance under the Food and Drug Regulations and they do not constitute an action for patent infringement. Subsection 8(3) of the NOC Regulations specifically provides for compensation without regard to infringement and Merck's defense with allegations of infringement conflicts with the established scheme.
