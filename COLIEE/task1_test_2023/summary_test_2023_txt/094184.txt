This is a case of judicial review regarding the decision by a delegate of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to deny Fadi El Doukhi a stateless Palestinian exemption from obtaining a permanent resident visa for humanitarian and compassionate reasons. The applicant had previously been denied refugee protection and had submitted an H&C application that was also rejected. The issues include the appropriate standards of review consideration of statelessness and violation of procedural fairness. The applicant also claims to have suffered from severe depression and illness.This document outlines an immigration case where the Applicant appeals the decision to reject their humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) application. The issues raised include whether the Officer erred by not taking into account the Applicant's statelessness if the Officer used the wrong threshold test and if the Applicant would face unusual and undeserved hardship if returned to Lebanon. The appropriate standards of review are discussed and arguments are made regarding procedural fairness and the Applicant's legitimate expectation of statelessness being considered in their H&C application.
