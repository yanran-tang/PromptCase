Rakesh Gautam and Nirmal Devi Gautam Indian citizens who claimed refugee status in Canada in 1994 due to their support of the Sikh movement for an independent Khalistan had their refugee claim rejected in 1996 and were subsequently held ineligible to remain in Canada. They then applied unsuccessfully for landing on humanitarian and compassionate grounds and their current application for judicial review of the decision to reject their claim was dismissed. The officer found that the Gautams had not demonstrated sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds despite their stable work history time in Canada and community involvement.
