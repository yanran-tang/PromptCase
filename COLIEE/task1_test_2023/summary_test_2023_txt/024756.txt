The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board that the applicants citizens of St. Vincent and the Grenadines were not Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Board's decision was largely based on the applicant's lack of credibility with regards to the timeline of events and various discrepancies in her testimony. The application for judicial review was dismissed.
