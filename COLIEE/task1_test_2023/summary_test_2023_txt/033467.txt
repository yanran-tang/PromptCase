Chief Engineer Donald MacKenzie claims unpaid wages for his years of service on ships owned by Socanav and argues that the amounts are secured by a maritime lien against the proceeds of the sale of Defendant ships. However a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) claim prioritizes MacKenzie's claim; at the time of dispute the amount was $73286.84 including an unpaid bonus and eight months of wages for wrongful dismissal. The dispute comes down to whether MacKenzie's claim for damages gives rise to a maritime lien which CIBC disputes.Mr. MacKenzie worked on three ships for eight years before his employment was terminated due to the bankruptcy of Socanav. Following the sale of the ships and resolution of third-party claims Mr. MacKenzie is the remaining claimant for $120000 plus accrued interest. While the court agrees with the Prothonotary's decision regarding bonus payments it concludes that Mr. MacKenzie is entitled to a maritime lien for his claim to damages.
