The applicants a married couple and their two children arrived in Canada as Convention refugees in 1989 from Poland. Their refugee claim was rejected in 1990 and leave to appeal and apply for landing from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds were also denied. The case proceeded with only evidence that was before the decision-maker excluding a report that post-dated the decision. The applicants are seeking relief through a writ of certiorari and mandamus.Mr. and Mrs. Lemiecha and their children are being reviewed by an office to determine if there are any humanitarian grounds for them to remain in Canada. The office has received letters of support educational certificates and an employment offer for Teresa Lemiecha.

A medical report on the son Rafal reveals a history of hospitalizations and treatment for asthma in Poland. Unfortunately the medical update was not promptly forwarded to the Immigration Centre.
