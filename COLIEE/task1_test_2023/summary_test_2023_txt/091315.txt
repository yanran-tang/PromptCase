This case involves a judicial review of a decision to deny humanitarian or compassionate grounds for a family to remain in Canada. The family arrived in Canada from Poland and claimed refugee status which was rejected. They later applied for landing on humanitarian and compassionate grounds which was also rejected. The review was based only on evidence that was before the decision-maker and the family sought a writ of certiorari and mandamus for their case.The Lemiecha family has been assessed by the Ottawa Office and it has been determined that their home country is not dangerous for them to return to. The final stage is a review by the recipient's office to decide if there are any humanitarian and compassionate grounds for them to stay in Canada. The family has provided letters of support and evidence of their contributions to the community but further medical information is required for their son Rafal. Unfortunately this was not provided on time and may have caused delays in the immigration process. A medical report later received indicates that Rafal suffered from asthma and was treated regularly by ambulance physicians in Poland.
