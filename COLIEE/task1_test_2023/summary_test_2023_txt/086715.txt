The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision of a Board of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration Refugee Board which refused the applicant's application to be deemed a Convention refugee or person in need of protection. The applicant claimed refugee protection on the grounds of sexual harassment and fraud by her uncle in Mexico. The Board found that state protection existed for individuals like the applicant in Mexico and the applicant had not met the burden of establishing a lack of protection.The Board found that the applicant's claim for refugee status was not well-founded as she had fabricated her story of sexual abuse by her uncle in order to gain refugee status. Additionally even if her story were true there was adequate state protection available in Mexico which she failed to seek. The Board also noted that the applicant had not established her employment status and failed to provide evidence of financial resources to seek legal help.In this case the Board rejected the applicant's claim for refugee protection stating that she had not reasonably exhausted all state protection options available to her in Mexico and had not proved clear and convincing evidence of state unwillingness or inability to protect her. The Board found that the applicant had a viable internal flight alternative and that there was no serious possibility of persecution torture or cruel and unusual treatment if she returned to Mexico. The applicant raises multiple issues on this decision. The statute relevant to this case is the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act which defines a convention refugee.
