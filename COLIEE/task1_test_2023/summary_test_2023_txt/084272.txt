Canada Games Company Limited the owner of the YO-YO trademark opposed an application for the registration of the trademark YOS by Llumar Star Kites. Llumar manufactures toys identical to Canada Games' Toy and distributes them through identical trade channels. The Trademarks Opposition Board granted Llumar's application for registration citing the absence of confusion between the two trademarks. Canada Games appealed the decision based on the premise that Martin who granted the application made a finding of fact which concluded that the YO-YO trademark was invalid when he accepted Llumar's evidence that YO-YO is the name of the Toy. The court dismissed the appeal stating that Martin had the jurisdiction to conclude that YO-YO had become the name of the Toy and this conclusion did not negatively impact the validity of Canada Games' trademarks.
