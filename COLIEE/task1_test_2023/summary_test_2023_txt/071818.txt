In 2001 Mr. Verville and 15 correctional officers at a maximum security prison in British Columbia refused to carry out their duties due to an order restricting their ability to carry handcuffs at their discretion. While a health and safety officer ruled that the officers were not in danger he found that the CSC was in contravention of the Canada Labour Code. However the appeal officer later overturned this finding. Mr. Verville sought judicial review arguing that the appeal officer ignored evidence and applied the wrong standard of proof. It was revealed that the CSC's restriction on handcuffs was a new implementation based on the Dynamic Security Model.Correctional officers at the Kent penitentiary were allowed to carry handcuffs with some officers routinely wearing them due to the likelihood of physical confrontations with inmates. However in September 2001 a memo was sent advising supervisors not to carry handcuffs unless authorized following a risk assessment. Despite this a risk assessment was carried out in November of the same year recommending that the current practice of routinely issuing handcuffs to supervisors continue due to the high likelihood of confrontation with inmates.ation between inmates the officers at the Living Unit Post may not have immediate access to handcuffs batons or O/C Spray. However he stated that staff can quickly obtain these items in consultation with a supervisor if necessary. The need for such items is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and risk assessments are regularly conducted to ensure the safety of both staff and inmates. Despite concerns raised by some officers no independent expert evidence was presented to support the claim that the measures in place were insufficient.
