Kenneth Kreklewich's request for relief from unpaid taxes in relation to his 1995 1996 and 1997 income tax years was denied after a request for fairness relief by the Minister of National Revenue. Mr. Kreklewich claimed that the audit was not carried out in a fair or timely manner and that he was not provided with a breakdown of the amount owed. The Federal Court dismissed Mr. Kreklewich's application for judicial review.
