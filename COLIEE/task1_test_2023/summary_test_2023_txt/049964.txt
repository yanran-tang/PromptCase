This is an application for a stay of a deportation order filed by Said Haji Mohamed Berhan who sought to reopen his claim for refugee status in Canada. Despite concerns about the potential danger and medical hardship he and his family would face upon deportation the court found that it did not have the authority to grant the stay and dismissed the application.
