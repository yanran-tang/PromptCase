The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is seeking judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) that rejected the Minister's application to vacate the determination that Birout Wahab is a Convention refugee. The Minister argues that the RPD erred in particular by considering new evidence that was not before the original decision-maker and by providing insufficient reasons. The Court finds that the decision under review must be set aside.A Russian citizen living in Canada was found to have made material misrepresentations on his refugee application but was granted refugee protection as there was other sufficient evidence that he was in danger in Russia. The decision was based on the information available at the time of the initial application.
