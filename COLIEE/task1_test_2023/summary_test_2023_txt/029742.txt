The applicant a Sri Lankan Tamil man sought judicial review of a decision made by the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) that he did not meet the definition of a Convention refugee. The tribunal's reasoning was found to be lacking and flawed as it made no assessment of the applicant's evidence of persecution and mistreatment did not consider recognized human rights standards and assumed that only young Tamils were the object of Sri Lankan police and security operations. The application was allowed and the decision was set aside and referred back to a different panel of the CRDD for reconsideration.
