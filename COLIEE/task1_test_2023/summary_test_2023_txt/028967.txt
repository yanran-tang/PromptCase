This case involves a veteran seeking a disability pension due to neck disease caused by a military accident in 1958. Despite a medical report from his family doctor and later an orthopedic surgeon his claim was rejected by the Pension Commission and appealed to the Entitlement Board and Veterans Appeal Board all stating it was age-related and not connected to his military service. In 1996 when new medical evidence was presented the Veterans Review and Appeal Board refused to reconsider their decision leading to a judicial review.Mr. Mackay's claim for war veterans' pensions based on a neck injury sustained in a 1958 motor vehicle accident was denied by the Veterans Appeal Board (VAB) and its decision was upheld by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board (VRAB). The applicant submitted medical reports from two physicians Dr. Clough and Dr. Murdoch to support his claim. However the VAB and VRAB found that there was no record of a neck problem until 1988 and concluded that the medical evidence did not raise a doubt about their decision.This is a legal case regarding the reconsideration of a decision made by the Veterans Appeal Board. The applicant requested reconsideration based on new evidence provided by Dr. F.T. Murdoch but the Veterans Review and Appeal Board rejected the request stating that the evidence was speculative and did not add anything new to the original claim. The case involves questions of jurisdictional errors natural justice and the proper application of the legal test for reconsideration. The analysis focuses on relevant sections of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act and examines how the VRAB is authorized to reconsider decisions and what constitutes new evidence.
