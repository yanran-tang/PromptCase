The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration brought an application for judicial review to challenge a decision by the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board to allow the appeal of a Canadian citizen who sought approval for the sponsored application for permanent residence of his adopted son who lived in the Philippines. The court found that the tribunal erred in law by not also assessing whether an adoption created a relationship of parent and child and referred the matter back to the Immigration and Refugee Board for redetermination.
