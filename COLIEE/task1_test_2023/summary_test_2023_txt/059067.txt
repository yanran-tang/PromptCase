The appeal in this case relates to the jurisdiction of a prothonotary to strike out a pleading pursuant to rule 419(1) of the Federal Court Rules. The court determined that a prothonotary does have jurisdiction to hear applications under rule 419(1) as authorized in section 46(1)(h) of the Federal Court Act. The court also dismissed the defendants' application to strike out the plaintiffs' statement of claim relating to copyright infringement as it established a possible cause of action that should be heard by a trial judge.
