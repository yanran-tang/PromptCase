The applicant a citizen of Ukraine filed for a stay of execution on a removal order challenging the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) decision and the negative Humanitarian and Compassionate decision (H&C). The court applied a tripartite test to determine whether to grant the stay and found that the applicant failed to establish that there was a serious issue to be tried or that he would suffer irreparable harm. Additionally the H&C Officer's assessment of risk was not erroneous and the Officer properly considered the applicant's established life in Canada and potential risk as a Baptist in the Ukraine.the Applicant has been found not to face a risk of persecution in his home country the Officer determined that there was no unusual undue or disproportionate hardship that would warrant granting him an H&C exemption to remain in Canada despite being out of status since 2002. The Applicant's establishment in Canada while knowingly in a state of uncertainty about his immigration status was considered less relevant.
