The Prothonotary Hargrave denied a respondent's motion to remove two types of documentary evidence and related paragraphs from affidavits in a judicial review stating that only evidence before the decision-maker should be considered but leaving the affidavits as contextual background information. The court should not be involved in preliminary jousting over the content of affidavits as the reviewing judge will be better placed to assess weight and admissibility. Special circumstances are necessary for moving to strike out affidavits but no such circumstances exist in this case.
