In this case the applicant was challenging the decision of the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which dismissed his appeal of the denial of his spouse's sponsored permanent residence visa application. The applicant argued that the panel erred in finding that the marriage was not genuine and entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status in Canada. The court found that important evidence including the couple's videotaped marriage ceremonies and photographs was not considered by the panel and the case was returned for reconsideration by a differently constituted panel.
