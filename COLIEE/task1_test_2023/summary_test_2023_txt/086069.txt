The case concerns the citizenship application of Ms. Chan under s.5(c) of the Citizenship Act. She spent only 162 days in Canada in the four years before her application leaving her 933 days short. Although she was a dependant student during this period she did not establish residency in Canada in mind and fact. The court found that her application was premature and that she had not centralized her mode of living in Canada during the relevant period. The appeal was dismissed.
