The Refugee Protection Division denied Maria Isabel Ribeiro Da Costa Soares' claim for refugee status in Canada citing a lack of subjective fear and the availability of state protection in Portugal. The Judicial Review application sought to overturn this decision but the court found no grounds for intervention. Da Costa Soares alleged domestic violence at the hands of her former husband and had been living in Canada without status for three years before submitting her claim.The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) denied Da Coasta Soares' claim for refugee status stating that her removal to Portugal would not put her at risk of torture cruel or unusual punishment. Several issues surrounding the case are being challenged including whether the Board broke procedural fairness rules if they erred in state protection and if they properly applied gender-related persecution guidelines. The IRPA outlined that a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution for their race religion nationality social grouping or political opinion can be categorized as a Convention refugee. A person in need of protection is someone in Canada who would be subjected to torture cruel or unusual treatment or punishment in their country of nationality or former residence.
