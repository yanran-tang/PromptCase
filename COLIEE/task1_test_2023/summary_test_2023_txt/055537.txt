This is a judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada in which it found that the Albanian applicants were not Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The RPD's decision was based on the lack of a nexus between the risks identified by the applicants and their race religion nationality political opinion or membership in a particular social group. The applicants claimed fear of a blood feud and submitted attestation letters in support of their claims.The Refugees Protection Division (RPD) dismissed the claim of a family from Albania seeking asylum in Canada due to a blood feud as it found that they had not taken all the objectively reasonable steps to obtain state protection. The RPD gave little weight to letters from various sources attesting to the danger faced by the family as it doubted their legitimacy due to doubts raised on the professional integrity of the sources and the existence of networks providing false papers to asylum seekers.The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision by the RPD that the applicant was not a Convention refugee. The court discussed the standard of review for credibility findings and mixed fact and law findings. The court also held that innocent victims of blood feuds are not considered to be members of a particular social group under Canadian law. Therefore the RPD did not err in its assessment of the s 96 claim.
