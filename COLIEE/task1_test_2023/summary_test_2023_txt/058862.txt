Mr. Martinez-Soto who was accepted as a Convention refugee in Canada applied for a stay of his deportation order by the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD). The IAD rejected his appeal under section 68 of the Immigration Appeal Division on the grounds that he had not rehabilitated himself. However the Federal Court held that the IAD's interpretation of rehabilitation factor was too restrictive and therefore unreasonably decided. The court allowed the application for judicial review and ordered the appeal to be remitted for redetermination by another tribunal.
