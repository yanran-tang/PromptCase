Alicia Shedene Simpson's refugee claim was based on her being a member of a social group of women in Jamaica who faced domestic violence. Simpson claims she was sexually abused by her stepfather who then threatened to kill her and her mother. Despite going to the police multiple times they did nothing to help her so she fled Jamaica out of fear for her life. The Refugee Protection Division denied her claim leading to this application for judicial review.A Jamaican woman who came to Canada under a student visa filed a refugee claim citing fears of returning to Jamaica due to her stepfather's interest in her and the lack of state protection. However the board did not find sufficient evidence to support her claim for protection and refused it noting that the state of Jamaica had a police force in place and that failed to provide effective policing but State protection couldn't be refused in these cases. The Applicant raised issues related to the availability of evidence and state protection but the board denied the claim.
