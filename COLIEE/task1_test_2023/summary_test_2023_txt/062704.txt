This case concerns a dispute between Transport Canada and an employee represented by their collective bargaining agent over a shift change that eliminated the employee's day of rest. The matter was referred to adjudication where the adjudicator found that the employer had violated the collective agreement by failing to consult the affected employee before making the scheduling change. The employer sought judicial review but the court found that the decision of the adjudicator was reasonably supported by the evidence and dismissed the application.
