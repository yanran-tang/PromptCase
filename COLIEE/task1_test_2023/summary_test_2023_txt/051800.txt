The case involves a judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which found that the applicant from Haiti was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The panel's decision was based on a lack of subjective fear credibility issues and the generalized risk faced by all citizens of Haiti. The court found that the panel's decision was reasonable based on the evidence presented and no questions were proposed for certification.
