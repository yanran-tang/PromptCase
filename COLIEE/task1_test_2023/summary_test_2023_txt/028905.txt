Pharmaceutical company Apotex has started legal proceedings against Pharmascience claiming the latter has infringed Canadian Patent No. 2100836 with pharmaceutical tablets containing ticlopidine hydrochloride making them liable for infringement. Pharmascience denies this claiming patent ‘836 is void and that the claims do not cover all ticlopidine hydrochloride formulations containing stearic acid. The issue in the case is the extent of discovery in a patent case. A ruling has ordered Pharmascience to answer some of Apotex’s questions relating to the dispute but a number remain unanswered.
