The case involves immigration officers denying landing to individuals who are part of the backlog class defined by the Refugee Claimants Designated Class Regulations on the grounds that they did not meet the requirements of paragraph 19(1)(b) of the Immigration Act. The applicants argue that members of the backlog class are exempt from meeting these requirements and that the decision should be made by an adjudicator not an immigration officer. The Governor-in-Council issued the Backlog Regulations allowing members of the class to apply for landing subject to meeting certain requirements.This case involves the interpretation of Canadian immigration law regarding the landing of people in the backlog class. The applicants argue that once a person is determined to fall within the backlog class they do not need to meet the requirements of paragraph 19(1)(b) of the Act to obtain landing. However the court rejects this argument stating that simply falling within the backlog class does not automatically entitle one to land in Canada.
