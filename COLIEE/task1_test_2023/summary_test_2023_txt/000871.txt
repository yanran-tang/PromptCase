This is an unedited case regarding an application for judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division which refused the applicants' applications to be deemed Convention refugees or persons in need of protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The applicants are all citizens of Colombia fearing the FARC guerrillas and currently living in Toronto since 2010. The Principal Applicant had received a threatening letter and was forced to pay FARC off but was later bound and threatened after only paying half of the demanded amount.The Principal Applicant and his family sold off their possessions and fled Colombia to protect themselves from threats made by FARC. They reported the threats to the Colombian authorities but did not receive adequate assistance. The family eventually sought protection in Canada but the Refugee Protection Division found that the Principal Applicant had not established a serious possibility of persecution or risk of torture.The Canadian Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denied a Colombian couple's claim for protection stating that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption of state protection in Colombia. The RPD added that it did not believe the couple was being threatened by anyone in Colombia and found that the principal applicant had fabricated his entire story of threats extortion and assault to bolster his fraudulent claim for protection. The RPD noted that Colombia has experienced forty years of conflict between government forces and guerrillas and paramilitary organizations that have caused many civilian casualties and have internally displaced many Colombian citizens.An asylum seeker from Colombia claimed to be threatened and extorted by FARC but the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found his testimony confusing and noted that he only went to the authorities to create evidence for his fraudulent refugee claim. The RPD also found that he did not give the non-police entities he had approached for help enough time to investigate his complaints before leaving Colombia.
