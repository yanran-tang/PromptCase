The case involves an application for judicial review on the basis of a decision dated October 23 2012 which found that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The applicant is a Turkish citizen of Kurdish ethnicity who wished to be recognized as a conscientious objector however the panel determined that there was not a serious possibility that the applicant would be persecuted on the basis of his race and nationality and that the penalties for evasion of military service do not constitute persecution as per the definition of refugee. The application was ultimately dismissed.
