The Dervishi family citizens of Albania claimed they were at risk upon their return to Albania due to rampant human trafficking and the targeting of those who have lived in the West by kidnappers. However a pre-removal risk assessment officer determined there was insufficient evidence to indicate the state would be unable or unwilling to provide them with protection. The family sought judicial review of the negative PRRA decision and it was allowed due to the inadequacy of the officer's analysis. The matter was remitted to a different officer.
