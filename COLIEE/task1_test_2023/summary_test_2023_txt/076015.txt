Mr. Wing Tse seeks judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision not to deal with his complaint against his former employer Federal Express Canada Ltd. because it was filed more than a year after the alleged discriminatory acts occurred. The complaint alleged that he was dismissed in retaliation for filing previous human rights complaints and that the company did not accommodate his disability. This is one of two applications for judicial review ordered to be heard together.The case involves Mr. Tse who was terminated from his employment with Federal Express. He filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) alleging that his dismissal was retaliatory for prior human rights complaints. The investigator assigned to his case noted that the complaint was filed 14 months after his termination and that Mr. Tse was aware of the CHRC's process but chose not to file a complaint until later. Federal Express argued that the complaint was trivial frivolous vexatious and made in bad faith.
