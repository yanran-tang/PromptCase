The Attorney General of Canada has nominated William P. Kelly as the officer to be examined for discovery on behalf of the Crown but the plaintiff seeks an order of the court nominating Pierre Cadieux the Minister of Labour as the appropriate officer in a case seeking a declaration that the Maintenance of Ports Operation Act 1986 S.C. 1986 chapter 46 is inconsistent with the provisions of the Charter. The judge rules against the plaintiff stating that the nominee can satisfactorily provide objective facts in the litigation regardless of their personal opinions or policies. The judge orders the examination for discovery to be held in Vancouver.
