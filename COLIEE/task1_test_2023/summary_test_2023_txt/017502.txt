Karamuddin Sherzad a permanent resident of Canada and citizen of Afghanistan was sentenced to pre-trial detention in 2002 for assaulting his wife and mother-in-law which resulted in his deportation from Canada. He appealed against the deportation order before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) but the IAD dismissed his appeal on the grounds that he had served a term of imprisonment greater than two years as stipulated in section 64 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Sherzad challenges the IADâ€™s decision arguing that his pre-trial detention should not have been considered as punishment and the IAD erred in admitting post-hearing evidence to support the deportation order.Mr. Sherzad was sentenced to 14 months in jail for aggravated assault assault causing bodily harm and failing to comply with the terms of his bail. He argues that the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) erred in admitting post-hearing evidence considering his pre-sentence detention as punishment and failing to consider the time he spent in jail after his sentencing. The standard of review is correctness for the second and third issues and a discretionary standard with significant deference for the first issue.
