This case involves an application for judicial review of a negative decision on an application for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds. The applicant Maria Guadalupe Lopez Segura is a citizen of Mexico who made a refugee claim in Canada due to abuse by her ex-partner in Mexico. Her refugee claim was rejected and she subsequently filed an H&C application and an application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment both of which were also rejected. The Officer determined that the grounds put forward for the exemption did not constitute unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardships. The application for judicial review is dismissed.l the factors the officer concluded that Ms. Lopez Segura did not meet the requirements for refugee protection in Canada. The officer found that state protection was available and there was no significant hardship for the applicant to access it even though it may not have been perfect. The officer also found that the hardship of relocating to Mexico would not be unusual and undeserved or disproportionate for the applicant or her son. Finally the officer observed that the applicant had established herself in Canada but held that she would have anticipated the consequences of her removal.
