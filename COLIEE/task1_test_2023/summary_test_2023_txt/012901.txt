The case involves a mother and daughter who are seeking Convention refugee status in Canada due to their fear of persecution in Sri Lanka. They claim to have experienced persecution from both the Sri Lankan Armed Forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The applicants were arrested in Colombo and interrogated about their knowledge of the LTTE and were released without conditions but warned to be supportive of the government. The Refugee Division denied their request for Convention refugee status.Two Sri Lankan applicants fled to Canada due to fear of persecution by the LTTE in Jaffna. The Refugee Division found their fear to be well-founded but also found an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Colombo where they were detained for six hours and released without conditions. The Refugee Division concluded that there was no basis for the applicants to fear persecution in the Colombo area and that they were not Convention refugees. Counsel for the applicants contested the decision claiming that the Board erred in ignoring relevant evidence and misconstruing the evidence before it.The case involves applicants claiming refugee status based on their Tamil nationality in Colombo. The jurisdiction for judicial review in these cases falls under the Trial Division in section 82.1(1) of the Immigration Act and the grounds for review are listed in section 18.1(14) of the Federal Court Act. The appropriate standard of review for errors of law and fact is discussed with the Supreme Court of Canada favoring deference to administrative tribunals except in cases involving Charter or constitutional rights.
