In this judicial review case the complainant a Community Case Management Officer claimed reporting pay under a collective agreement for two phone calls received at home from colleagues outside of her working hours. The employer only agreed to pay her for 30 minutes of overtime which led to a grievance being filed and referred to adjudication. The adjudicator allowed the grievance and the employer was directed to pay the complainant according to the applicable clause in the collective agreement which states that an employee must be paid if they are called back to work outside of their scheduled hours. The adjudicator also determined that the complainant's home became her workplace during the time of the phone calls.The case concerns the interpretation of clause M-29.01 of a collective agreement specifically whether an employee returning to work from home qualifies for standby pay. The court appears to recognize that the employee did report to work when called to return even if they did not physically go to their usual workplace. The court exercises judicial restraint stating that special consideration should be given to decisions made by administrative tribunals in labor relations.
