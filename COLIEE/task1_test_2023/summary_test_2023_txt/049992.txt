The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision made by a visa officer denying a Pakistani citizen a permanent residence visa in Canada. The visa officer denied the applicant for failing to receive at least 70 units of assessment and also under s. 11(2)(a) of the Immigration Regulations 1978 as there was no demand for the assessed occupation. The applicant had worked as an Electrical Wiring Inspector in Pakistan and as a Limousine Driver in the US but was found not to have sufficient skills to qualify as an Electrical Wiring Inspector under the Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations (CCDO). The applicant was also not assessed under his alternative occupation of Automotive Maintenance Equipment Servicer as he did not meet the requirements for that occupation. The visa officer awarded the applicant two units of assessment for personal suitability taking into account factors such as the applicant's lack of knowledge of Canada his unwillingness to upgrade his skills and his use of false documents. The application for judicial review was denied and the decision of the visa officer was upheld.
