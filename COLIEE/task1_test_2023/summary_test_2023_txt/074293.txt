German citizen and Canadian landed immigrant Bertold was ordered deported but he sought judicial review. The Federal Court of Canada Trial Division found that the Board erred in considering country conditions in Germany and that Bertold's Charter rights were violated when the Board referred to outstanding charges against him in Germany. The Court referred the matter for determination by a differently constituted panel of the Board.The applicant seeks to set aside the Immigration Appeal Division's decision and requests that relief be granted under section 70 of the Immigration Act. The applicant also asks for the matter to be sent back to a different panel of the IAD. However the applicant's memorandum of fact and law are longer than the limit set by the Federal Court Rules. The applicant's application raises issues regarding possible breaches of his Charter rights but it is unclear whether the applicant seeks to challenge the validity of the customs agreement. The applicant had made misrepresentations in his application for permanent residence that led to the issuance of a deportation order.The case involves a man who was convicted of multiple crimes including joint murder and robbery in Germany as a juvenile but had his records expunged under German rehabilitation legislation. He was extradited to Germany from the United States in 1984 for a probation violation and was sentenced to three years imprisonment. He later started his own car business and became involved in a legal dispute over the sale of a Ferrari in 1989. The man and his wife spent more time in Canada where they were involved in training sled dogs and purchased property. They also had a daughter who is a Canadian citizen.
