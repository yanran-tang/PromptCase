The Federal Court of Canada dismisses an Application for Judicial Review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada in which the Board rejected a Chinese national's claim for refugee protection. The Board rejected the Applicant's claim based on his failure to establish his identity and credibility. The Applicant argued that the identity finding was unreasonable but the Court found that it was reasonable and dismissed the Application for Judicial Review.
