pplicant a police officer employed by the Kanesatake Mohawk Police Force sought judicial review of a decision that he was not unjustly dismissed. The decision was made by the Kanesatake Mohawk Police Commission which was created by an agreement between the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake the federal and provincial governments to govern the Force. The agreement expired in 2004 and was not renewed leading to the applicant's dismissal.An applicant filed a complaint with the Canada Labour Board claiming he was unjustly dismissed by the Council. A Labour Affairs officer investigated but couldn't resolve the matter so it was referred to arbitration. The arbitrator Claude Lauzon found that he had to first determine if a dismissal had even occurred before deciding if it was unjust. The applicant brought a notice for judicial review but was unsuccessful. The legislative provisions at the heart of the matter concern unjust dismissal.
