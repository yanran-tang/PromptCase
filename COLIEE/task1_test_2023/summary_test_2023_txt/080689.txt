The judicial review allowed the applicants' claim and referred the matter back for reconsideration by a different panel after it found the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board had not provided natural justice due to not listing that credibility was an issue during the hearing despite stating it could be at the start. The Board later found the applicants' evidence not credible resulting in a denial of justice. The decision was based on the panel's negative assessment of the applicant's credibility.
