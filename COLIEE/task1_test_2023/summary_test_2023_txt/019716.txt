The Right Honourable Jean Chrétien the Honourable Alfonso Gagliano and Mr. Jean Pelletier each sought judicial review to quash the Phase I Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Sponsorship Program and Advertising Activities. They individually requested various materials from the Commission under Rule 317 of the Federal Courts Rules. The Commission objected to providing certain materials requested by each applicant and Chrétien Gagliano and Pelletier separately moved for orders that the Commission provide certified copies of this material.
