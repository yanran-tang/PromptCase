The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision by a visa officer at the Canadian Embassy in Kyiv Ukraine denying the applicant's application for a temporary work permit. The applicant a citizen of Ukraine had applied for a job as a cook in Canada but was refused because she did not submit income tax returns from when she worked in the UK which the officer deemed relevant for determining her admissibility. The court ultimately found that the decision was reasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
