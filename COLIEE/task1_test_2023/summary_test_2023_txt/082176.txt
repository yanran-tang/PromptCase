Richard a German citizen who arrived in Canada in 1990 was convicted of multiple fraud and breach of trust charges in Germany prior to his arrival. In 1994 an immigration adjudicator ordered his deportation citing his membership in the inadmissible class outlined in s. 19(1)(c) of the Immigration Act. Richard seeks judicial review of the decision arguing errors in the adjudicator's handling of evidence and equivalency between German and Canadian fraud offenses. He seeks a declaration that he is not inadmissible an order quashing the deportation and further relief.On May 18 1994 an immigration adjudicator determined that the applicant was inadmissible under s.19(1)(c) due to convictions for fraud in Germany which were equivalent to the offence described in s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code.
