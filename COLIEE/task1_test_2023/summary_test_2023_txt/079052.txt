The case involves the arrest of a 32000-tonne bulk carrier Bocsa which was under hire to the plaintiff in Vancouver. The defendant the vessel owner seeks to set aside the arrest and have certain statements in the Statement of Claim struck out. At issue is the identity of the entity letting the ship as there were two documents referred to as the fixture recap and the Welsh Coal Charter both with different details.A legal case involving the breach of a charter party agreement for the carriage of goods from Vancouver to Eregli caused by the detention of the vessel due to numerous deficiencies. The plaintiff applied for the arrest of the vessel and claimed damages for breach of the agreement. The defendant owner posted security and eventually departed in ballast. The Welsh Coal Charter is said to be the relevant document for the case.The case involves a dispute between the plaintiff the charterer of a vessel and the defendant the owner of the vessel. The plaintiff claims damages for breach of contract as the defendant failed to carry the cargo from Vancouver to Eregli. The defendant seeks to have the statement of claim and arrest warrant struck out arguing that they disclose no reasonable cause of action and that the court is without jurisdiction. The possibility of arbitration under clause 44 of the Welsh Coal Charter is mentioned but it is not further explored.The defendant requested the production of a fixture recap which they argued should be considered a pleading and taken into account when determining whether the plaintiff's claim was reasonable. However the court disagreed stating that a document produced under rule 407(2) is not automatically a pleading. The defendant also claimed that the proceeding was an abuse of process but the court did not find sufficient evidence to support this argument.
