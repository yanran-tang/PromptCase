The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting the applicants' claim for protection as refugees or as persons in need of protection. The applicants citizens of Tunisia are Christians and fear persecution in their country. The RPD concluded that there was insufficient evidence that they would face persecution on the basis of their religious beliefs if they were to return to Tunisia. The Court dismissed the application for judicial review finding no violation of the applicants' right to a legal proceeding in the language of their choice no failure to consider relevant evidence or the applicants' testimony and no reasonable apprehension of bias.
