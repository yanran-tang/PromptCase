Ali Shiraz Naqvi a Pakistani citizen and member of the Shia sect applied for refugee status in Canada due to fear of persecution at the hands of Sunni extremists. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected Naqvi's claim citing improved state protection for Shia citizens. Naqvi's application was overturned by the Federal Court which found that the RPD relied on outdated evidence and ignored recent reports of ongoing violence and harassment of religious minorities in Pakistan. The case was remanded for rehearing by a different officer.
