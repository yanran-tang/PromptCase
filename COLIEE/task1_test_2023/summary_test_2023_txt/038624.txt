The case of Orlando Jack a 22-year-old citizen of St. Vincent and the Grenadines who sought protection in Canada alleging a fear of persecution as a member of a particular social group namely victims perceived to be homosexual. The applicant's claim was rejected by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board and this is the judicial review of the Board's decision.The applicant in this case claimed to have suffered abuse for being perceived as a homosexual in St. Vincent but the Board did not find evidence of a well-founded fear of persecution or need for protection. The Board found that state protection was available in St. Vincent and the applicant did not seek help from the police after being attacked by villagers. Despite acknowledging discrimination against homosexuals in St. Vincent the Board concluded that state protection was available and reasonable efforts should have been made to seek it.
