A citizen of China with a Bachelor of Arts degree from York University was denied permanent residency in Canada under the Canadian Experience Class due to her lack of experience in the desired occupation despite her administrative and translation work at a small law firm in Toronto. The reviewing officer cited a low salary and lack of sufficient job duties. The applicant challenges the use of wage data and questions the standard of review applicable to the decision.The case involves an applicant whose experience is being assessed for the Canadian Experience Class. The officer utilized HRSDC wage data to determine the type of work performed but failed to disclose this to the applicant. The Court found that the standard of review applicable to the officer's assessment of the applicant's experience is reasonableness and set aside the decision remitting the application to another visa officer for re-determination following provision of an opportunity to the applicant to make submissions regarding the HRSDC wage data.This passage discusses various issues related to a visa officer's decision including: the applicable standard of review for alleged errors whether certain portions of an officer's affidavit should be struck whether the officer was entitled to consider data from a government website and whether to rule on the officer's assessment of the applicant's experience or whether the applicant meets the requirements of a specific job. The parties disagree on the standard of review for interpretations of the rules with the applicant arguing for correctness and the respondent for reasonableness. Recent Supreme Court decisions suggest that reasonableness should apply while the Federal Court of Appeal has held that correctness applies.udential landscape has shifted since Patel was decided it is arguable whether the correctness standard should continue to be applied to visa officers' interpretations of the Regulations. The application of different standards for different provisions may result in a patchwork of judicial review in immigration law. The fifth issue in this case involves assessing the experience of a candidate which normally falls under the reasonableness standard of review although there are some statements in Khan that could be read as mandating a correctness standard for all aspects of a visa officer's decision.
