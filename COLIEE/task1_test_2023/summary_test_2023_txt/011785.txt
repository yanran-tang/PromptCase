The applicant Artur Franz sought to adduce fresh evidence in support of his claim for Convention Refugee status. He is a Jehovah's Witness who fears persecution for his religious beliefs if he returns to Poland. The Immigration and Refugee Board denied his claim but Franz attempted to introduce an article that cast doubt on the Board's finding that he had a reasonable expectation of being permitted to enter a program of alternative service. The court dismissed Franz's motion noting that the article was only marginally relevant and could have been submitted before the Board's decision.
