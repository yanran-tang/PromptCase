The case involves a citizen of the Central African Republic who claimed to fear persecution due to his nationality and political opinions. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board determined that a change in circumstances in the country negated the applicant's fear of persecution and he was not a person in need of protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Federal Court of Canada dismissed the application for judicial review finding the Board's decision to be reasonable.
