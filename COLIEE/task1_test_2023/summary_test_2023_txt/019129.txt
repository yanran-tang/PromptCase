Victor Johnston sought a judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision to not deal with his complaint alleging discriminatory treatment by his employer because it was based on acts that occurred over a year before the complaint was filed. Johnston argued that his complaint was filed within the one-year limit but the Commission decided not to extend the time limit. The court dismissed Johnston's application for judicial review finding no reviewable errors by the Commission in its decision-making process.
