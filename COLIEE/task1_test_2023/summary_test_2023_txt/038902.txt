This case concerns the interpretation of articles 96 and 97 of the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act regarding refugees and persons in need of protection. The Federal Court's judgment contains no summary as it is unedited. However the relevant provisions of the Act relating to risk assessment before deportation are included in the judgment.Giovanny Jehiel Cobian Flores applied for protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act but was rejected by the panel. He filed an application for a judicial review which was allowed primarily because the analysis of the availability of state protection should be preceded by an analysis of the refugee claimant's subjective fear of persecution including an assessment of credibility and plausibility of the applicant's claim. The case was remitted back to the Commission for reconsideration.The case concerns a young Mexican citizen who claims to be the son of a dangerous drug and human trafficker. Upon discovering this he reported his biological father to the police but they refused to accept his testimony. He was then threatened and eventually beaten by members of the police. The applicant alleges that he cannot rely on state protection in Mexico and seeks asylum in Canada.
