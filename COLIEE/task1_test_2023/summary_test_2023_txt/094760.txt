An Ahmadi man from Pakistan claimed refugee status in Canada based on a fear of persecution due to his religion. Despite experiencing discrimination and violence at the hands of non-state actors the Convention Refugee Determination Division found no objective basis for his fear of persecution as he was able to practise his religion and continue his studies. The court upheld this decision as the incidents did not amount to persecution and the State's ability to protect the applicant was not considered.
