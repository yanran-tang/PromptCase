The case is an application for judicial review of the Registrar of Trademarks decision to allow the respondent to adopt and use the MILLENNIUM as an official mark for wares and services. The applicant owns a Canadian trademark registration for the word MILLENNIUM for alcoholic beverages and the parties dispute when and how the respondent first adopted and used the official mark. The issues include whether an official mark can be expunged the timing of adoption and use and whether the respondent is entitled to adopt as an official mark the registered trademark of another trader in Canada.Whether a trademark is confusing should be given great weight but a judge hearing an appeal from the Registrar's decision must still determine the issue with due regard to the circumstances of the case. The standard of review for decisions of the Registrar is reasonableness but where new evidence is adduced in the Trial Division that would have materially affected the Registrar's findings of fact or the exercise of his discretion the Trial Division judge must come to their own conclusion as to the correctness of the Registrar's decision. The case at hand involves whether an official mark can be expunged by a court proceeding.
