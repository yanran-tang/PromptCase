The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) has lost an appeal in a trademark infringement lawsuit against Princess Group and Princess Auto. The court had granted the firms an extension of time to apply for judicial review of a decision of the Registrar of Trademarks issued 27 years ago. The CSA had sought a declaration that Princess had used its marks without permission or authority and that various trade-mark laws had been breached.
