The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board that the applicants were not Convention refugees. The principal applicant was found to be excluded from the definition of a Convention refugee due to serious reason to believe that he committed a crime against humanity based on his past employment in the Uruguayan military. The application raises issues regarding the exclusion clause which had been considered in recent Federal Court cases.The case describes the mistreatment and harassment faced by a former police officer in Uruguay for speaking out against human rights violations. The officer witnessed officers beating detainees and transporting injured individuals to clandestine detention centers instead of hospitals. He also reported an incident where he was ordered to transport what he believed to be a dead body to a desolate military property and was later threatened by the officers involved. He faced further harassment for signing a referendum against the Impunity Law and was arrested for neglecting to care for his firearm and uniform.The male applicant and his wife left Uruguay in 1991 after being harassed by officers. The Refugee Division determined that the male applicant did not qualify as a Convention refugee due to his involvement in surveillance work that led to potential persecution and his alleged aiding and abetting of those who tortured political prisoners. The female dependent did not face any threat in Uruguay and did not qualify as a refugee.
