A Brazilian lawyer fearing persecution in Brazil based on his sexual orientation sought protection in Canada. The Refugee Protection Division found him to be credible and to have a genuine subjective fear of persecution but determined that his claim was not objectively well-founded due to the availability of state protection in Brazil. In this judicial review it was alleged that the board member was biased in their decision but the court found no basis for alleging bias and dismissed the application.
