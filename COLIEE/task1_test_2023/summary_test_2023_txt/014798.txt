The Crown has applied to strike out the Statement of Claim of the plaintiffs as against her Majesty the Queen. The plaintiffs are members of the Blackfoot Band of Indians who believe that the election of the defendant Chief and Council was unlawful and invalid. The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the election is void an order for the resignation of the Chief and Council and damages from the Queen for breach of trust. The defendants apply for an order seeking relief including striking out the Statement of Claim and determining whether the court has jurisdiction.The legal issues raised by the Defendants Crown and Chief and Council differ so the court will deal with each separately. The Crown's Application to Strike is being made under rule 419(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules but no evidence can be admissible on such an application under rule 419(2). The Plaintiffs allege that the Crown is a Trustee of the Indian Band Members' Interests and as Counsel for the Crown stated the obligation is only to the Band. However the court declined to resolve this issue in the present judgment.
