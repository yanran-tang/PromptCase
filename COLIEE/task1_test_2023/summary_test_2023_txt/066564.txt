The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by a visa officer refusing the applicants' application for permanent residence due to misrepresentation in medical examinations. The key issue is whether the visa officer breached the duty to act fairly by failing to provide the medical evidence and x-rays to the applicant's counsel upon request. The Court found that the delay in providing the evidence and the instruction to make an access to information request were unfair and awarded costs to the applicant. The application was allowed and the visa officer's decision was quashed and set aside.
