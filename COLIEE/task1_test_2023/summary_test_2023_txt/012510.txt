The court has dismissed a motion to strike out affidavits in a judicial review case. While parties should not be allowed to strike out each other's affidavits special circumstances such as irrelevance or abuse may justify such an action. The court ruled that it is inappropriate to strike out whole affidavits or parts of them before cross-examination and that the issue of admissibility should be determined by the trial judge. The dismissal is without prejudice to similar submissions being made to the judge who hears the judicial review application.
