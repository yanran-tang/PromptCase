Janice Doerr applied for judicial review of a decision by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to dismiss her complaint against Bell Canada. Doerr who suffered from bi-lateral tendinitis alleged that Bell Canada failed to provide a workplace free of harassment and terminated her employment because of her disability. A lengthy acrimonious history between Doerr and Bell Canada complicated the case which was ultimately dismissed with each party ordered to bear their own costs.The case involves a complaint of harassment termination due to disability and retaliation against Bell Canada. An award was made by an arbitrator in 2003 but the complainant argued that not all the issues were addressed. The Canadian Human Rights Commission recommended dismissing the complaint but a supplementary report was issued in 2004 to deal with remaining allegations. The Commission dismissed the complaint in 2006 leading to the current review. Issues raised include the evidence considered by the Commission and the appropriate standard of review.
