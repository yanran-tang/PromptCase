This is a judicial review application regarding the decision of the Registrar of Trademarks to give public notice of the adoption and use by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) of the Millennium mark as an official mark for wares and services. The key issues in the case include whether an official mark can be expunged by a court proceeding whether the LCBO adopted and used the official mark before November 12 1998 and whether subparagraph 9(1)(n)(iii) of the Trade-marks Act is contrary to the Canadian Bill of Rights or the Constitution Act.The weight given to an official's conclusion on whether a trademark is confusing should not be set aside lightly. However a judge hearing an appeal can determine the issue with due regard to the circumstances of the case. If new material evidence is presented the judge must come to their own conclusion on the correctness of the Registrar's decision. In this case there is new evidence that would have materially affected the Registrar's decision on the official mark. The Court must determine whether an official mark can be expunged in a court proceeding.
