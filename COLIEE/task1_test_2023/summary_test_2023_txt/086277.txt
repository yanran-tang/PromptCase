Anthony Douglas MacDonald appealed the decision of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board denying him pension benefits under the Pension Act. MacDonald claimed to have suffered a back injury during his military service but the injury was not recorded in his medical records. Despite presenting new evidence in support of his claim the Board denied his entitlement to pension benefits. The court found that the Board erred in disregarding the new evidence presented and ordered that the matter be heard anew.
