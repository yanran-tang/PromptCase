Veronica Gathoni Kahiga claimed refugee protection in Canada based on her fear that her uncles in Kenya would force her into marriage against her will. However the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected her claim on the basis of lack of credibility. Despite arguing that the cumulative effect of the findings was unreasonable the court dismissed her application for judicial review and no question was certified.
