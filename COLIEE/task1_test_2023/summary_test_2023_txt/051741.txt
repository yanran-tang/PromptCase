The Refugee Protection Division accepted that Clemente Carrillo Garcia was subjected to abuse and violence due to his sexual orientation but rejected his refugee claim stating that he had an internal flight alternative in Mexico City. The Federal Court found that the Board erred in failing to address evidence relating to the availability of an internal flight alternative in Mexico City for openly gay men including a report showing that 65 of 125 homophobic hate crime killings in Mexico occurred in Mexico City. The matter was remitted for redetermination.
