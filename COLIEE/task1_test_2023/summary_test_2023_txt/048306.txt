Eli Lilly and Company and Eli Lilly Canada Inc. requested a motion hearing to consider their request to file reply evidence in a proceeding where they are seeking to quash the issuance of a Notice of Compliance to Apotex Inc. for the drug nizatidine. The applicants contend that the synthetic process disclosed in Apotex's New Drug Submission is not the same process set out in a letter dated November 29 1995 and they were unable to comment on the similarities due to Apotex's confidentiality claim. The court granted the applicants' request to submit reply evidence.
