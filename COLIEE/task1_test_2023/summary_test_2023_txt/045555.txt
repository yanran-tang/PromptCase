Victor Pilntiz applied for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board Refugee Division. The Board declared his claim abandoned as he failed to attend a hearing and did not provide a valid reason for his absence. The court rejected his submissions that the Board should have granted an adjournment and breached natural justice finding no breach of his right to counsel and the Board's decision was reasonable.
