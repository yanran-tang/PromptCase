The case involves a family of five who applied for permanent residency in Canada based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. They claim they faced risk to their lives and security if they were forced to return to India to make their application. The judicial review application raises questions of whether the tribunal failed to properly assess their H&C application whether the tribunal erred in its risk assessment and whether the best interests of the children were taken into account. The Singh family are citizens of India and are Sikhs. They claim that their father was harassed and died after giving testimony to a commission of inquiry into the 1984 riots in New Delhi.The Singh family fled India and sought refugee status in Canada in 2005. Their claim for refugee protection was refused in 2006 due to inconsistencies in the principal applicant's story but they applied under humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds in 2006. The officer denied their H&C application due to lack of establishment and risk but granted on compassionate grounds due to the principal applicant's health problems.
