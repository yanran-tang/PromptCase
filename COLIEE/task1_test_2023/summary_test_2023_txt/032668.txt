The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision of Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which found that the applicant Justin Colby is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The Board determined that the determinative issue was state protection and that the applicant failed to exhaust all recourse available to him in the US before claiming refugee status in Canada. The court found that the Board's determination on state protection was reasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
