The Canadian Drug Manufacturers Association (CDMA) has sought leave to intervene in an interlocutory injunction proceeding initiated by Pfizer against the Federal Government and Apotex. Pfizer is seeking a declaration that Canadian Letters Patent No. 1130815 relating to its drug Zoloft is valid until October 30 2000 and an interim injunction to prevent the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance to any other drug manufacturer until the trial takes place. The CDMA representing Canada's generic drug manufacturers has been granted intervention rights for the interlocutory injunction proceedings.
