In this case a student from Bogota claimed that he was forced to be a member of a group called FARC and threatened with violence. The Refugee Protection Division did not question the student's credibility but failed to consider the state protection needed from the perspective of the applicant. This along with the failure to explain doubts on credibility led to a reviewable error of law and the matter was referred for redetermination by a different panel.
