The Institute of Canadian Advertising (ICA) has applied to intervene in a case involving the constitutional validity of the Tobacco Products Control Act in Canada. The ICA hopes to voice concerns about the effect of the legislation on commercial free speech and the right to advertise lawful products arguing that it has a direct financial impact on agency members that work with the tobacco industry. However the judge dismisses the application on the grounds that the ICA has not satisfied the criteria for intervention and that its views will be adequately represented by the plaintiff in the main action.
