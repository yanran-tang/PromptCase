Pharmaceutical company Apotex Inc. and Bernard Charles Sherman have filed a lawsuit against Pharmascience for infringing on Canadian Patent No. 2100836 by producing pharmaceutical tablets containing ticlopidine hydrochloride. During the examination for discovery of the defendant's representative many questions went unanswered with the plaintiffs now attempting to have the order set aside. The case hinges on whether Patent '826 vests Apotex with exclusive rights to compositions of ticlopidine hydrochloride along with stearic acid that are substantially free of any other organic acid. Pharmascience denies infringement and argues that the patent is invalid.
