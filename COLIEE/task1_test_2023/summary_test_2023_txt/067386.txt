A government employee representing himself sought a judicial review after being denied recourse rights. The respondent argued the decision was made in 2001 and that the 2003 letter was just a courtesy so the applicant sought to introduce 162 supplemental documents via a motion but was denied as they were either irrelevant or could have been available earlier. The applicant was also criticized for not understanding the rules and procedures involved in the court. The respondent was awarded costs.
