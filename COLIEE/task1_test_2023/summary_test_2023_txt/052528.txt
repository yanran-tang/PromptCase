The applicant Sergiy Chorny sought Convention refugee status in Canada due to anti-Semitic persecution in Ukraine but the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected his claims. The applicant seeks judicial review of that decision with the court ultimately ruling that his application should not succeed citing a viable internal flight alternative in Kiev and that the Board's decision was not patently unreasonable.The concept of IFA (Internal Flight Alternative) which refers to seeking safe refuge within one's own country is inherent in the definition of a Convention refugee. The claimant must establish a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country including any alleged IFA. The appropriate standard of review for IFA findings is patent unreasonableness and the Board must properly apply the test for determining whether an IFA exists. The Board erred in failing to address whether the Applicant would be at risk of persecution in Kiev and whether state protection in Kiev would be any different from state protection in the Odessa area.
