This case involves an appeal by the plaintiff from reassessments of their income for the 1978 and 1979 taxation years. The central issue is whether the plaintiff's business during 1978 was a manufacturing and processing of goods for sale or lease as defined in the Income Tax Act. The plaintiff claimed a deduction for Canadian manufacturing and processing profits which was disallowed by the Minister. The Minister argued that the plaintiff was providing a service to the medical profession and their patients rather than selling or leasing goods. The radiographs or x-ray films were taken and developed by qualified technicians employed by the plaintiff with the radiologists only involved in the professional and diagnostic stage of interpretation of the x-ray film. The fees for these services were billed to OHIP in 90% of cases and were split between the technical and professional components of the bill.The case involves the deductibility of a tax credit claimed by Dixie X-Ray Corporation from its manufacturing and processing profits. The issue revolves around whether the company's activities amount to the processing of goods for sale which would make it eligible for the tax credit. Dixie X-Ray provides x-ray services and stores films for a stipulated period before selling them for silver recovery. The company charges fees for its services and allocates them to radiologists who perform the professional reading of the x-rays.
