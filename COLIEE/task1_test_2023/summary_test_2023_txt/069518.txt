The case involves a Notice of Allegation sent by Apotex to the applicants under the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations 1996. The applicants sought judicial review for an order declaring that the letter of October 15 1996 sent by Apotex to the applicants was not an allegation under s. 5 of the Regulations. The issue was whether the three requirements under s. 5 must be met before the expiration of the 45-day period after service of an allegation. The court dismissed the application finding that the allegation is a live issue that can be dealt with by the courts.
