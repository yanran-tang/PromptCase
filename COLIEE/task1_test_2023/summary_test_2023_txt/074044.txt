The Federal Court denied a citizen of Ukraine's motion for a stay preventing his removal from Canada. The applicant had challenged the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment and the negative Humanitarian and Compassionate decision based on his fear of persecution as a Baptist in Ukraine. However the court found that the applicant failed to establish a serious issue to be tried and that the balance of convenience did not favour him.the Applicant has been found not to be at risk of persecution and has no exceptional circumstances the Officer's decision that he has not demonstrated unusual undue or disproportionate hardship in leaving Canada is reasonable. The Applicant's establishment in Canada while out of status is not a significant factor in the analysis.
