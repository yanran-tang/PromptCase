This is a judicial review of a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which held that the applicant a Roman Catholic from Fuzhou China was not a Convention Refugee. The applicant claims a fear of persecution based on religion and imputed political opinion. She also argues that she is a refugee sur place because her illegal exit and subsequent refugee claim would express political opinion and that she would suffer fines beatings and imprisonment if sent back to China.UK's refusal to grant asylum to a Chinese national who taught catechism at an unregistered church to be justified as it found the applicant's claims regarding the risk of persecution upon her return to China to be implausible. The decision-maker relied on evidence suggesting that China allows religious practice and does not necessarily persecute unregistered religious groups. The decision also questioned the credibility of the applicant's claims.
