Mr. Perez Enriquez a Mexican citizen applied for permanent residency in Canada as a skilled worker in 2010. After being laid off from his initial position as a management consultant his application was ultimately refused due to a failure to provide sufficient evidence of one year of continuous full-time employment within the preceding ten years as required by the regulations. The Applicant sought to challenge this decision but the court found it to be reasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review. No question for certification was proposed.
