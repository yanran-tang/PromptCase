A Canadian tribunal's order to deport a family back to their homeland of Germany has been set aside and referred to a newly constituted panel for rehearing. The decision was made following the discovery that a significant part of the evidence from the applicants and interpreter was omitted due to poor interpretation and three minor applicants not being present. The hearing will now ensure that all the applicants are present all the children are asked if they wish to testify and counsel for the applicants agree in advance to the interpreters being used.
