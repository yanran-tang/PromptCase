Ms. Li applied for judicial review of an Immigration Officer's decision to deny her request for exemption from visa requirements to remain in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Ms. Li failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove her religious beliefs posed a risk to her return to China. She also failed to mention her grandchild's best interests resulting in her inability to seek exemption on that basis. The decision was set aside due to a procedural fairness breach and the matter was remitted for determination by a different immigration officer.
