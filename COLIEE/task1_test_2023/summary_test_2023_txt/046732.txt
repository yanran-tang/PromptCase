The case involves an application for an interlocutory injunction to prevent defendants and their retailers from marketing their brushes using packaging similar to the plaintiff's or causing confusion between the two brands or passing off the defendant's brushes as the plaintiff's. While the plaintiff raised serious questions of copyright infringement and passing off the court found that damages would provide an adequate remedy and there were serious difficulties in proving both claims. Additionally the court refused to issue an interlocutory injunction in respect of the alleged patent infringement.
