Eleven shipboard nurses filed a lawsuit for overtime in 2001 followed by five more in 2003. The case was ordered to be case-managed in 2003 with a schedule filed for a pretrial conference. The discovery was split into an initial written phase and a revised schedule filed in August 2003. By 2004 a fresh schedule had been filed which proved unworkable and a case management order was issued in June 2004. Plaintiffs were expected to submit their affidavit answers to written discovery by 1 November 2004 but by April 1 2005 some of the Plaintiffs had not provided their affidavit answers which led to the defendants applying for either striking out the defaulting plaintiffs or for yet another schedule.The case involves a breach of a court order to provide discovery answers by November 2004 with only one plaintiff providing answers by January 11 2005 and the remaining plaintiffs providing their answers between February and March. The plaintiffs' counsel provides reasons for the delay citing the length and organization of the answers and the fact that much of the correspondence has been done by mail. The plaintiffs' counsel also seeks an extension of the deadline but fails to provide sufficient affidavit evidence.
