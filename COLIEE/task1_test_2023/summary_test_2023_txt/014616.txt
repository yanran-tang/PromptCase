Mr. Stuart Kidd who was terminated from his job as a Millwright Helper due to alcoholism sought judicial review of a decision made by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to not deal with his human rights complaint as it wasn't brought within a year of the alleged discriminatory events. The applicant's employment relationship was governed by a collective agreement between the respondent and the applicant's union the Public Service Alliance of Canada and the matter was referred to arbitration which ultimately upheld his discharge from employment.The case involves a complaint of discrimination based on disability in employment. The complainant alleged that the employer failed to accommodate him to the point of undue hardship contrary to several sections of the CHRA. The Commission chose not to deal with the complaint as it was based on acts that occurred more than one year before the complaint was filed. However the court found that the Commission's decision lacked adequate reasons and violated the principles of procedural fairness.
