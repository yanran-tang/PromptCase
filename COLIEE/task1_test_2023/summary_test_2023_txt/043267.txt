The court hears arguments in a sentencing case involving the release of an inmate under mandatory supervision. The inmate's counsel argues that the Board has lost jurisdiction due to a failure to strictly comply with statutory notice periods resulting from a custodial service strike. However the court rules that the provisions in question are regulatory rather than mandatory and are not penal in nature. The application is dismissed.
