The applicant made an order for the cross-examination of Ms. Lerner-Frank to be video-taped in Hong Kong for which the applicant would pay. The respondent wants a copy of the video-tape but both parties disagree on who should pay for it. The court ruled that the usual convention should apply: the party being examined should pay for the transcript or video-tape. The respondent must pay $100 for a copy of the video-tape and the applicant is awarded costs of $500.
