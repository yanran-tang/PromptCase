The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision of the Tribunal of the Immigration and Refugee Board which determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a decision rejecting an application for landing in Canada of a citizen of India sponsored by the applicant. The Tribunal found that the adoption of the sponsoree did not comply with the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 1956 as the required intent was lacking and the sponsoree was not a member of the family class under the Immigration Regulations 1978. The court found that the Tribunal did not err in its decision and dismissed the application. The court also certified one of the proposed questions for general importance within the meaning of s. 83(1) of the Immigration Act.
