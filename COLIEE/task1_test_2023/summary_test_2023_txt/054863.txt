Mr. Bankole a Nigerian citizen sought judicial review of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board that he was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. He claimed harassment from his former political party and an attack resulting in personal injuries and car damage. The Board found his claim lacked credible basis and that adequate state protection was available. The court found no breach of natural justice despite concerns with the Board member's questioning and dismissed the application. No questions were certified.
