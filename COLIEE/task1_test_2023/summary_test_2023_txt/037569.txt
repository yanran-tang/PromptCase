This is a case of an application for judicial review of the negative decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The applicant Sehlule Nyathi is a citizen of Zimbabwe and claims a well-founded fear of persecution from the ruling ZANU-PF party on the basis of her political opinion. The Board rejected her claim for asylum which was challenged on two issues on judicial review: whether the Board made a erroneous finding of fact and whether the Board committed an error of law in concluding that the applicant is not a person in need of protection. The court dismissed the application for judicial review finding that the Board's determination that the applicant's story was implausible in the circumstances was reasonably open to it. The court also found that the Board erred by failing to expressly deal with the applicant's s. 97 claim but that this error was not material to the result.
