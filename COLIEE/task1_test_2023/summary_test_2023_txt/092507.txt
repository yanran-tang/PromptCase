Ms. Ched a citizen of Cambodia claimed refugee status in Canada alleging that her husband and two sons were arrested and disappeared by the Cambodian National Police. However a member of the Refugee Protection Division rejected her claim stating that she was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection as her claim was fabricated for the purposes of this claim. Ms. Ched appealed to the Federal Court which dismissed her appeal as the panel's decision was based on the lack of credibility of the applicant's testimony.
