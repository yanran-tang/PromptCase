The plaintiff filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the defendants but later discontinued it. The defendants however refused to discontinue their counterclaim challenging the asserted patent. They applied for costs under Rule 402 which entitles a party against whom an action has been discontinued to costs forthwith. The assessment officer refused the plaintiff's request for an adjournment pending the outcome of the counterclaim and awarded costs to the defendants.Both sides are disputing the costs of the main action with the defendants claiming double fees for certain items citing Rule 420(2)(b) as justification. The defendants made a settlement offer which the plaintiff did not formally respond to resulting in the defendants claiming entitlement to double costs even though the case was discontinued. The interpretation of Rule 420(2)(b) is being debated.The Plaintiff brought a patent infringement action but the court invalidated the patent due to prior disclosure. The Defendants provided the Plaintiff with relevant technical drawings before the patent was issued and the Plaintiff was informed about the invalidating effect of the disclosure. The Plaintiff must bear the consequences of double costs for commencing the action. The Defendants argued that the settlement offer was a genuine attempt at compromise since it ensured the Plaintiff's patent would remain in force. The Plaintiff argued that consultations with expert witnesses should be recognized in the Tariff but the Defendants disagreed. The Plaintiff's invention was disclosed to the public a year before the patent filing and the Defendants had sold a trailer with the subject suspension prior to the filing date.
