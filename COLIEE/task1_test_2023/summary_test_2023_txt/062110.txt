The appeal concerns whether the plaintiff was a class (I) farmer for the 1978-1980 tax years and thus entitled to deduct farming business losses under s. 31 of the Income Tax Act. A classification system was established with taxpayers falling into three categories that determine the amount of farming losses that can be deducted. The plaintiff was classified in the second category limiting them to a deduction of $5000 each year confirmed by the Tax Court of Canada.The plaintiff grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan and wanted to become a farmer. In 1975 he left his job at the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool for a one-year contract managing the Canada Farm Labour Pool Program. He has been continuously employed by the program ever since. In 1978 he bought 80 acres of land and started a sheep farming operation but severe drought and economic conditions prevented him from turning a profit.
