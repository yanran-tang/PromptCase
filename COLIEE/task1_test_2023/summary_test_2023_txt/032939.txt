The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board not to declare the applicants who are citizens of El Salvador as Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The applicants claimed persecution by state authorities and members of a political party but the Board found inconsistencies in their testimony and that they did not make an adequate effort to acquire state protection. The Federal Court found that the Board did not act in a patently unreasonable manner in its decision.
