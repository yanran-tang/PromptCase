The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia has requested a stay of proceedings against them pending the determination of their appeal from an order made on April 14 1987 by Madame Justice Reed which denied their motion for dismissal. In support of the motion the defendant's counsel argues that a stay is in the interest of justice as the appeal concerns the very jurisdiction of the court itself. However the plaintiff's counsel maintains that a stay would deprive their client of procedural advantages. The court ultimately decides against the stay finding that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the continuation of the action would be unjust or oppressive to them and that a stay would work an injustice on the plaintiff.
