The case involves Laszlo Horvath a citizen of Hungary and a person of Roma ethnicity who applied for refugee protection in Canada; however the Immigration and Refugee Board's Refugee Protection Division refused his claim stating that the treatment he faced did not amount to persecution and that state protection would be available from the Hungarian state. Horvath applied for a judicial review which was granted as the court found that the decision was unreasonable with respect to the finding of no persecution and adequate state protection.The RPD rejected a man's refugee protection claim finding that he had given inconsistent answers and failed to provide medical evidence to support his assertion of memory problems. The RPD also concluded that the discrimination and harassment suffered by the applicant did not amount to persecution and that state protection was available to him if he returned to Hungary despite acknowledging the country's history of discrimination against Roma people.
