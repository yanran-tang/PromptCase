Sandoz Canada is appealing the decision of Prothonotary Mireille Tabib which dismissed its motion under subsection 6(5)(a) and (b) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations. Sandoz has also moved for the dismissal of Abbott Laboratories' underlying application stating that the Abbott Patents are not relevant to the Notices of Compliance against which they were listed and the application is an abuse of process. The Prothonotary rejected both arguments stating that the claims in issue were never in the previous litigation and Abbott did not have a duty to put all claims into play in the earlier proceeding.The Federal Court of Canada ruled that Sandoz cannot delay Abbott Laboratories' release of its next-generation antibiotic ceftazidime/avibactam by claiming patent infringement on a substance patent covering clarithromycin Form II. Justice Locke found that Sandoz knew or could have known during litigation concerning Abbott's '361 Patent last year that Abbott intended to rely on its other patents in future. The ruling means that Sandoz should have dealt with the issues of Abbott's '482 Patent (Crystal Form II) at the same time as Abbott's '361 Patent according to the judgment.Abbott's patent for clarithromycin was upheld by the Federal Court of Canada which deemed that Sandoz's notion of non-infringement of the patent was plain and obvious. Sandoz was thus banned from selling its version of Abbott's antibiotic drug which generated roughly $47m of revenue in Canada last year.
