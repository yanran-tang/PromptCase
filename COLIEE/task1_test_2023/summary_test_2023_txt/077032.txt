This is a judicial review application of the Minister's decision to deny the applicant's request for interest on her retroactive disability benefits. The applicant first applied for disability benefits in 1977 but it was not until 2003 that she was found to be disabled. In 2007 the Minister granted her retroactive benefits based on her first application but the applicant requested a review alleging that the amount she was paid was too low and asked for interest on the retroactive payment. The Minister refused and this decision is under review.The letter from the Service Canada Centre explains the calculation of a retroactive payment for a Disability benefit but denies the request for interest on the payment due to the lack of provisions in CPP legislation. The application for judicial review questions the decision and timing of the letter and whether the Minister has the jurisdiction to award interest under CPP. The Federal Courts Act outlines the grounds for judicial review including unlawful acts errors in law and fact and acting contrary to law.Under Canadian law a request for judicial review must be made within 30 days of receiving a decision or order from the federal office and the Federal Court has the power to order the office in question to carry out their responsibilities and declare any actions unlawful. The Court may take these actions if it believes that the office acted without authority did not follow proper procedures made legal or factual errors or acted fraudulently. Additionally the Minister of Canada may take steps to rectify any benefits that were wrongfully denied due to an administrative error or erroneous advice.
