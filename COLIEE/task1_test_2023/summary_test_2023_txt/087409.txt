The defendant in a patent infringement case sought to stay a reference to damages resulting from a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal pending the Supreme Court of Canada's decision on whether to entertain their leave to appeal. The plaintiff argued that the matter should have been brought before the Federal Court of Appeal and that the expense and inconvenience of waiting for the Supreme Court's decision did not constitute irreparable harm. The court dismissed the application and awarded costs to the plaintiff.
