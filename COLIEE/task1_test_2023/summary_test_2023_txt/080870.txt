An application for judicial review in Canada challenges a decision that a couple from Guangxi province are not Convention refugees. The Refugee Appeal Division confirmed the couple's lack of refugee status but did not adhere to procedural fairness regarding the identification of issues or rely on more recent evidence of country conditions rendering the decision unreasonable. The original decision will be reconsidered. The couple claimed that they would be persecuted due to their Christianity and that the husband feared retaliation from corrupt police and criminals he had apprehended.The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) upheld a decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying refugee status to two applicants from China claiming persecution due to their Christian faith. The RAD found that the RPD had analyzed the possible risk of the applicants' return in accordance with section 97 of the Act and there was insufficient evidence to show that the applicants would face persecution in China as Christians. The RAD also rejected the applicants' arguments of procedural fairness breaches and admission of new evidence.
