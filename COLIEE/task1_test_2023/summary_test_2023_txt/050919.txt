A Russian citizen who had spent most of her life in Germany had her application for Canadian citizenship refused due to a residency requirement. During the four years before her application the woman had physically been present in Canada for 897 days but had visited Germany for 319 days to care for her ill mother. Although the woman argued that the Citizenship Judge had erred in applying the physical presence test rather than any other residency test and had acted with bias the Federal Court dismissed her appeal.
