The case concerns a reassessment made by the Minister of National Revenue of the income tax payable by Mr. Connell for the 1979 and 1980 taxation years related to his farming operations. The Tax Court of Canada allowed his appeal from those reassessments but gave no reasons for its conclusions. The criteria for determining whether the taxpayer's chief source of income is either farming or a combination of farming and some other source of income are discussed and ultimately the appeal is allowed and the Minister's reassessments are confirmed.
