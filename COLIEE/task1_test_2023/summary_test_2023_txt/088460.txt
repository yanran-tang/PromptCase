The case concerns a woman from Australia who came to Canada as a visitor and began living with a man who became her common-law spouse. They have two children together. She was issued an exclusion order and made an application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds which was refused. The applicant alleges she was subject to abuse by her former spouse in Australia and fears for her safety due to her involvement in reporting his involvement in a drug trafficking ring.A woman named in the document as the Applicant filed for a humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) exemption to remain in Canada due to hardship she and her family would face if forced to return to Australia. The Canadian immigration officer found that the Applicant had not provided sufficient evidence to show that she warranted the exemption and that Australia had sufficient state protection and that the Applicant had not achieved sufficient establishment to require Canada to provide the H&C exemption.
