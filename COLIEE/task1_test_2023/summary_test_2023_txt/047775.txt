The case involves a man Mr. Ebebe who came to Canada as a ship stowaway and committed immigration fraud by misrepresenting his identity and lying about his past to Canadian immigration authorities. He applied for humanitarian and compassionate relief under s. 25 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act but was denied due to his fraudulent conduct. The court found that the decision to deny relief was lawful and reasonable and met the standard of reasonableness simpliciter. While the decision did not preclude Mr. Ebebe's return to Canada the court recommended that the Minister expedite the processing of Mr. Ebebe's application for permanent residency under the sponsorship of his wife.
