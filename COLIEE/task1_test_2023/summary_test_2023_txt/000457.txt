Merck & Co. Inc. the largest innovative pharmaceutical company in the world filed a case seeking an interim and an interlocutory injunction against a Canadian company Merck Frosst Canada Inc. to prevent it from further infringing its Canadian Letters Patent 1275349 which includes claims to the compounds enalapril and enalapril maleate among others. Enalapril is marketed in Canada by Merck Frosst under the trademark Vasotec and is important to the company accounting for about one-third of its annual sales revenues.Apotex Inc. a Canadian generic drug manufacturer has been accused of infringing on Merck Frosst's patent for the hypertension drug Vasotec. Apotex claims to have acquired substantial quantities of enalapril maleate in bulk prior to the issuance of the Merck patent and had anticipated obtaining an NOC (Notice of Compliance) to market its version under the trademark Apo-Enalapril. However Merck accused Apotex of producing tablets with the same chemical composition as the patented material leading to a legal dispute.Merck sued Apotex for alleged patent infringement of enalapril and enalapril maleate. Apotex denies infringement and claims that the enalapril maleate used in its tablets was manufactured in Canada before Merck's patent was issued. The legal proceedings began in 1991 and have gone through several developments including Merck's application for an order to inspect and test Apotex's product and Apotex's application for judicial review to compel the Minister of National Health and Welfare to issue NOCs for its products. Additionally Merck and other pharmaceutical companies involved Apotex in proceedings in the US prohibiting the sale of unauthorized drug products through mail order arrangements.
