The Director General of the Therapeutic Products Directorate has referred a question of law to the court regarding the application of s.7 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations. The court has ultimately ruled that the Minister is not precluded by s. 7(1)(b) of the NOC Regulations from issuing a notice of compliance to Apotex for the new claims referred to in the reference question because Apotex complied with the obligations imposed under s. 5 of the NOC Regulations by serving its NOA and filing proof of such service in 1993.
