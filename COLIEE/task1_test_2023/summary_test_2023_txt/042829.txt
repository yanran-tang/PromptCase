Her Majesty the Queen made an application under section 40 of the Federal Court Act seeking an order that the respondents not be permitted to institute further proceedings in this Court without leave and that all pending proceedings previously instituted by the respondents not be continued except with leave of the Court. The affidavits filed by the applicant did not comply with rule 81(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1998 SOR/98-106 and did not indicate why evidence based on personal knowledge was not before the Court.The case involved errors in a legal affidavit submitted to support a claim against the Crown. The errors were due to non-compliance with the requirement that affidavits must be sworn by individuals with personal knowledge who carefully review them. Despite this the court chose not to dismiss the case but rather used its discretion under rule 55 to allow for the deficiency and draw an adverse inference. The respondents argued that the case should proceed as they were entitled to bring their claims to court.The court reviews evidence relating to the identification of true copies of legal documents filed and issued by the court as well as recorded entries in previous proceedings involving the respondents. The court finds evidence relating to the respondents' conduct in courts outside of this court to be of little relevance with the exception of their designation as vexatious litigants. The case involves charges against Olympia Interiors Ltd. and its president Mary David for offenses under the Excise Tax Act which were ultimately stayed leading to financial difficulties for the company and personal bankruptcy for David.
