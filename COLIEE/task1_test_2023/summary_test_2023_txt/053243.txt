Mr. Deniz Kilic a citizen of Turkey and a member of the Circassian Alevi community sought refugee status in Canada based on his ethnicity religion political opinion and fear of persecution for evading military conscription. The Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board denied his claim but allowed post-hearing evidence of a call-up notice from the Turkish military which confirmed his status as a draft evader. Mr. Kilic seeks judicial review of the Board's decision.Mr. Kilic failed to arrange for his dispatch and was regarded as an absentee from conscription facing a serious prison sentence. However the Refugee Protection Board found fault with his claims and did not find him to qualify as a person in need of protection under section 97 of IRPA. The Board also acknowledged the impact of his post-traumatic stress disorder on his testimony but found it did not support his claims.
