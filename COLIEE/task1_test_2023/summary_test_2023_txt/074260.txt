The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board declaring the applicant Mr. Vivar inadmissible pursuant to subsection 35(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for allegedly being complicit in crimes against humanity committed by the Republican Guard in Peru between 1974 and 1985. Mr. Vivar argues that he did not personally commit any human rights violations and that he should not be held responsible for the actions of others.The Federal Court of Canada upheld a deportation order against former Peruvian army officer Luis Enrique Martin-Vivar. The government claims that Martin-Vivar was complicit in human rights abuses committed by the Peruvian authorities between 1981 and 1985 including torture arbitrary arrest execution of prisoners and enforced disappearances. Martin-Vivar denies the claims but the court found that he was aware of the events that transpired during his military service and was therefore complicit in crimes against humanity.
