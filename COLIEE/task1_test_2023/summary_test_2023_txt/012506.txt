Imperial is seeking to strike paragraph five of Rothmans' Statement of Defence in a case relating to a claim by Imperial for a declaration that letters patent 2011254 is invalid or if valid for a declaration that Imperial's product does not infringe that patent. The paragraph in question outlines the circumstances leading to the commencement of the action and Imperial argues it is irrelevant to the issues at hand. Counsel for Rothmans argues that it is relevant to the issue of solicitor/client costs and to their request for consolidation of the two related actions. The court rules that portions of the paragraph can be struck but not all of it.
