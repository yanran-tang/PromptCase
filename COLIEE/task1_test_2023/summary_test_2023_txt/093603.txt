his Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The applicant Claudette Marri Martin is seeking a judicial review of the Immigration Appeal Division's decision to dismiss her appeal based on a lack of jurisdiction. She was found inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality under section 36(1) of the IRPA due to her conviction of importing cocaine into Canada and her acknowledgement of an instrument in a false name.The case involves an applicant found to be inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality and a deportation order was issued. The applicant filed an appeal but it was dismissed citing a provision in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The applicant now seeks a judicial review arguing that the decision lacks jurisdiction and violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The case highlights the complexities of immigration law and the importance of understanding the relevant statutory provisions.The applicant argues that section 64(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) does not apply to her as her actual prison sentence only lasted six months. She claims that the phrase punished in Canada by a term of imprisonment in the IRPA refers to the time actually served in prison. She also argues that section 64 violates her right to liberty in a manner that does not comply with the requirements of fundamental justice.The Supreme Court has ruled that the Charter of Rights requires a mechanism that ensures fundamental justice balancing personal circumstances with a state's interests prior to deportation. While an appeal to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board is not necessary the application process and determination of the best interests of a child must happen before deportation. Those who are found inadmissible due to serious criminality in Canada with a punishment of two or more years do not have a right of appeal under s. 64(2) of the IRPA.
