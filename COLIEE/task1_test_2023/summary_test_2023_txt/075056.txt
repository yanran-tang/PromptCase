This case involves a dispute over claims to the proceeds of sale of three vessels by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and Chief Engineer Donald MacKenzie. CIBC argues that their mortgages on the ships give them priority while MacKenzie claims unpaid wages and damages for wrongful dismissal. The court finds that MacKenzie's claims do not give rise to a maritime lien except for vacation pay and personal expenses which CIBC concedes. These amounts are to be paid to MacKenzie while the remainder is paid to CIBC.
