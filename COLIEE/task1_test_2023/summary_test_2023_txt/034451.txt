This is a case of an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Immigration and Refugee Board's Refugee Protection Division which found that the applicant a 27-year-old Kurdish Muslim from Turkey is neither a refugee nor a person in need of protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The applicant claimed refugee status on the basis of his objection to military service as a conscientious objector as well as his Kurdish ethnicity. The court found the decision to be reasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
