Abdel Hakim Ayaichia a 29-year-old Algerian citizen claimed refugee status in Canada arguing that he feared for his life because he reported a murder in which his colleague was killed. He claimed persecution under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and was also a person in need of protection under section 97. However the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada rejected his claims under both sections. Ayaichia applied for judicial review claiming that the Board had breached procedural fairness and erred in failing to conduct a separate analysis of his claim under section 97. The court dismissed his application finding that the Board had not committed any reviewable error.
