Heinz registered the trademark OX & PALM in Canada for corned meat and tinned meat. It secured a Canadian distributor in 2010 and Centennial Foodservice-Worldsource purchased 1660 cartons of OX & PALM corned beef. The Registrar issued a notice requesting evidence of use and McCallum Industries Limited commenced a Federal Court application to expunge Heinz's OX & PALM registration. The court rejected McCallum's application in 2011.In 2011 tinned meat products with the OX & PALM trademark were sold in Vancouver. In 2013 the Registrar issued a decision that the trademark had been used in Canada during the Relevant Period despite the applicant's argument that there must have been actual possession of the wares for use to occur. The Registrar relied on a previous decision and noted that section 45 proceedings were meant to be simple and expeditious. The issue of special circumstances to excuse the absence of use was also discussed. The Trade-marks Act provisions regarding the use of trademarks were outlined.
