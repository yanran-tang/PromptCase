This case concerns an Albanian citizen's application for refugee status in Canada after he claimed he was at risk of persecution from a blood feud as a result of his cousin killing a man. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board denied the application citing issues with credibility and the availability of state protection and internal flight alternatives. The applicant then sought judicial review.The Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board rejected an Albanian man's refugee claim stating that he did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that he had a well-founded fear of persecution in his home country due to a blood feud. The board also stated that state protection was available to him and he could have availed himself of an internal flight alternative. They found inconsistencies in the applicant's testimony and rejected his argument that he could not seek protection from the authorities.
