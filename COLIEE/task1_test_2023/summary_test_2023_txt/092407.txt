The Métis National Council has applied to be an intervenor in an action seeking declarations of breached constitutional obligations owed to Métis people who were displaced from hunting fishing and trapping in a northern Saskatchewan area. The applicant seeks intervenor status due to possible impacts on other Métis people and possessing relevant knowledge and expertise. The plaintiffs support the motion while the defendants claim the applicant cannot meet the requirements for intervenor status. However the court determined that the applicant brings sufficient value to the litigation granting intervenor status in the case.
