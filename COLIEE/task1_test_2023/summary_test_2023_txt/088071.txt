The plaintiff seeks to convert an action to an application for judicial review under the Federal Court Act with regards to their resignation from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a refusal by the RCMP to allow withdrawal of the resignation. The court can convert an application for judicial review to an action but not vice versa. The plaintiff did not meet the test for an extension of time set by jurisprudence and the application was dismissed with costs.
