The case concerns an application for judicial review of a negative Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) decision for two Guatemalan citizens who claimed they would face persecution and torture if returned to Guatemala due to their perceived family relationship with a past President. The PRRA officer found there was insufficient credible new evidence to persuade her to arrive at a different conclusion than the original Refugee Protection Division (RPD) panel. The court dismissed their application for judicial review finding that the PRRA officer considered all relevant evidence and did not err in ignoring new evidence that could have been raised before the RPD.
