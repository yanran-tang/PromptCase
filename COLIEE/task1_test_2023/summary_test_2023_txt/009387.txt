Magdalini Karathanos applied for permanent residence in Canada as an archivist but was rejected as she did not have the necessary qualifications. A visa officer stated that she did not meet the employment requirements for the occupation of archivist which includes a master's degree in archival studies library science or history. However the officer erred as the National Occupational Classification indicates that a master's degree is usually required for an archivist not always required. The decision was quashed and the application was referred back for reconsideration.
