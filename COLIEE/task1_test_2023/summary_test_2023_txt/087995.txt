Dana Sproule alleged that Canada Post Corporation (CPC) failed to accommodate her disabilities after she suffered repetitive strain injuries while employed. The Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed her complaint and this case deals with her application for judicial review of that decision. CPC provided Functional Ability Forms (FAFs) to the Applicant but after she stopped working her FAFs no longer reached CPC. The Respondent argued that it was the Applicant's responsibility to ensure that CPC was apprised of her medical condition through FAFs.The Applicant Ms. Sproule had claimed repetitive injury to both her wrists while working at the SLB section. She received an updated FAF with limitations on her right hand only. Her supervisor offered her modified employment using an ergo arm or working at SLB pre-cull only but Ms. Sproule declined both offers insisting that she could work in VES. Her supervisor advised her to stay off work if she felt incapable of working within the restrictions provided by her physician.
