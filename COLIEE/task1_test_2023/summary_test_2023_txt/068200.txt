Dimplex North America Limited filed a Statement of Claim in 2002 alleging that certain defendants had infringed its patents related to flame simulating assemblies in electric fireplaces. In 2004 Dimplex sought to amend its Statement of Claim to add three individual defendants but Prothonotary Lafreni√®re disallowed the addition on the grounds that the allegations were insufficient to establish the personal liability of the individuals. On appeal the Federal Court partially allowed the appeal adding one of the individuals as a defendant but rejecting the addition of the other two.
