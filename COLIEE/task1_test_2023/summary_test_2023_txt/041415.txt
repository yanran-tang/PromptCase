The applicant a Canadian citizen who filed a sponsorship application to bring her Indian citizen husband to Canada was found not to have a genuine marriage by an immigration officer leading to multiple appeals from the applicant.Applicant's appeal the IAD applied the three-part test for issue estoppel and found that all conditions were met. Despite recognizing that new information could potentially overcome issue estoppel the IAD ultimately refused to exercise its discretion to hear the appeal based on the principle of res judicata. The IAD noted that it is a court of competent jurisdiction with expertise in immigration matters and considered several factors in its decision including the wording of its enabling statute available procedural safeguards and the potential for injustice.The IAD reviewed new evidence submitted by an applicant who was appealing a refusal of spousal sponsorship. Using a Supreme Court of Canada test the IAD determined that the evidence was not new and that injustice would not result if it were not considered. The IAD reviewed evidence including photographs money transfer receipts and phone bills ultimately finding that none were decisive of the genuineness of the marriage.
