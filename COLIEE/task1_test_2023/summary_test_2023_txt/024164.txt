Davinder Singh Bagri a citizen of India claims refugee status in Canada due to fear of persecution by the Punjab police for his and his family's involvement in the Separatist Movement. The Immigration and Refugee Board (Refugee Division) concluded that he is not a Convention refugee within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the Immigration Act due to a lack of credibility and fabrication of evidence. After review the Federal Court finds the decision made in reviewable error and refers the matter back for redetermination.
