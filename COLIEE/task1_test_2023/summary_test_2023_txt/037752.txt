The case involves Mr. Kanagaratnam a permanent resident of Canada who was found inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality in 2006 and issued a deportation order. He appealed to the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which dismissed his appeal. Mr. Kanagaratnam then filed for judicial review of the decision arguing that the IAD failed to consider all the relevant factors in refusing to allow the appeal or to stay the deportation order. The Court ruled that the IAD took into account its concerns about Mr. Kanagaratnam's credibility and his lack of concrete action to address the issues that led to his criminal behavior and concluded that he had failed to establish the possibility of his rehabilitation. The application for judicial review was dismissed.
