Artur Franz a Jehovah's Witness was denied Convention Refugee status by the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) in Canada in August 1993. In support of his claim he sought to adduce fresh evidence in November 1993 consisting of a newspaper article he received from his parents in June that year indicating that of 6000 applications for substitute service in 1993 less than half were accepted. The IRB concluded that general statistics on alternative service were relevant and that material relating to the treatment of Jehovah's Witnesses was of greater relevance. The court dismissed the motion to adduce fresh evidence due to its marginal relevance and the fact that it was available and could have been submitted before the IRB's decision.
