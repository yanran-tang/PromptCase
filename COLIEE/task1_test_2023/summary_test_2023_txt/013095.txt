The case involves a dispute over patent infringement between Merck and Apotex regarding Apotex's drug Apo-Lovastatin. Apotex is seeking damages for a delay in the issuance of a Notice of Compliance while Merck claims that Apotex infringed their patent and is not entitled to damages. The interesting question is whether Merck's defense will hold against Apotex's statutory right to damages. The case is still ongoing with no determination of Apotex's allegation of non-infringement in the prohibition proceeding.Apotex has filed a motion with the Federal Court of Canada seeking to strike certain paragraphs of Merck's plea in defense of Apotex's claim for damages. The paragraphs disclose no reasonable defense are immaterial redundant frivolous and vexatious and are an abuse of the court's process according to Apotex. The defense is inconsistent with the scheme of NOC Regulations says Apotex.Apotex is arguing that whether they had a non-infringing process for making lovastatin is irrelevant to the determination of a section 8 action. Section 8 imposes an absolute liability on the first person for any losses suffered by the second person due to the delay in issuing an NOC. The lack of relevance of patent infringement to a claim for damages for delay is evident from the objects of section 6 proceedings and subsection 8(3) of the NOC Regulations specifically provides that a section 8 damages award may be granted without regard to matters of infringement.
