The case involves an application for judicial review under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act where the applicant (a citizen of Sri Lanka) was denied refugee status by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board as he was found not to be credible. The applicant argued that the Board failed to conduct a separate analysis under section 97 of the Act but the court found that this was not necessary as there was a lack of evidence showing it was necessary. The application for judicial review was dismissed and no questions were certified.
