Merck Eli Lilly and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Canada (PMAC) have applied to be added as respondents or intervenors in a judicial review brought by Apotex Inc. The case concerns the validity of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations which govern the issuance of notices of compliance for patented medicines. The decision will affect the pharmaceutical industry and consumers of its products and could undermine the cause of action which supports Prohibition Proceedings. The court ruled in favor of Merck Eli Lilly and PMAC's participation in the case.
