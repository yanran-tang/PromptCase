The Canadian Minister appealed a decision granting citizenship to Kehua Yu who had spent only 17 days in Canada before leaving to study in the United States. The judge concluded that an initial residency had not been established and therefore failed to meet the Citizenship Act's residency requirement despite her living in Canada for the required period after her application. The decision was not a reflection on Yu who was expected to be a significant contributor in Canada.
