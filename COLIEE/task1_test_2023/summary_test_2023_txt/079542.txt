This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division. The applicant was denied her appeal from a removal order issued against her for willfully misrepresenting a material fact upon entering Canada as a permanent resident. The misrepresentation related to the existence of her two eldest children which she failed to declare in her application for permanent residence. The applicant appealed but was ultimately deemed inadmissible under paragraph 40(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.The Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) found that the applicant was not credible and assigned little weight to her testimony. The IAD also found that there was no trustworthy evidence to suggest a conscious decision was made not to examine the applicant's undeclared children. The IAD ultimately determined that special relief was not warranted taking into account the seriousness of the misrepresentation the length of time spent in Canada family community and potential foreign hardship faced in the likely country of removal.
