YM Sales Inc. applied for a judicial review of the decision made by the Minister of International Trade to refuse their application to amend import permits which would have resulted in the remittance of $1.5 million. The import permits were originally obtained under NAFTA but the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency was not satisfied that the goods originated from the NAFTA free trade zone resulting in the goods being subject to a duty at the Most Favoured Nations rate. The Minister refused to amend the import permits resulting in YM Sales Inc. applying for a judicial review. The court dismissed the application for judicial review.The Canadian Export and Import Permits Act requires an import permit to be issued for goods listed on the Import Control List (ICL) including for the purpose of monitoring quota levels under NAFTA. The Minister has discretion over issuing permits but must issue them for goods listed solely for the purpose of collecting information. The Minister can amend suspend cancel or reinstate permits under certain circumstances.
