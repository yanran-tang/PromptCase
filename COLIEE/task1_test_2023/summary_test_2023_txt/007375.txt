The applicant is seeking a stay of the execution of a deportation order while his application for leave and for judicial review of a decision that he constitutes a danger to the public in Canada is pending. He has a long criminal record and is claiming that his separation from his family and community support if deported to Italy would result in irreparable harm. The court has granted the stay subject to conditions as it finds that the harm to the applicant outweighs the public interest.
