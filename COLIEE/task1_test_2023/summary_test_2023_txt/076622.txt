The First Nations fishery near Yale BC is a prime salmon fishing area and the Yale Indian Band is challenging the right of the Minister of Fisheries to issue an aboriginal communal salmon fishing licence which allows the Lower Fraser River Indian Bands to fish in the same area using traditional methods. The Fisheries Council of BC seeks to intervene in the proceedings but the onus is on them to show they have a legitimate interest and can bring relevant viewpoints or expertise to the matter.The case involves a dispute between the Yale First Nation and the Lower Fraser Bands over the right to fish in a salmon fishery in the Fraser River. The Yale Band claims aboriginal right and title in a particular reach of the river while the Lower Fraser Bands contest this claim saying they have a joint tenure to the use of the river. The issue was brought to a head when a communal fishing license was granted to the Lower Fraser Bands allowing them to fish in the disputed territory. The Yale Band argues that this authorization infringes on their aboriginal right to fish.
