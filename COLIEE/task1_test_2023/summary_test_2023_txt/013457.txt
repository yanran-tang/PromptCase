This case involves an application for judicial review by the Salt River First Nation 195 against certain individuals who were elected as councillors in November 2002. The applicants were seeking relief for certain activities that occurred in connection with the affairs of the SRFN. The court allowed the application and an order was issued for individuals to appear to show cause why they should not be held in contempt of court. The relevant facts involve elections for chief and council in August and November 2002.An order was made in January 2003 freezing the bank accounts and investments of BC Investments and 4491 NT Ltd. and 4992 NT Ltd. until further court order or all parties' consent with exception to the amount owing for taxation. The court also restricted various other bank accounts operated by the Band for payroll and other payments without the approval of both parties' counsel. Further orders were made to protect the money of the Salt River First Nation who received more than $60 million as part of a treaty land entitlement claim.A court order was issued to restore the Salt River First Nation 195's duly elected Band Council with specific signing authorities and to provide copies of all bank statements with counsel expenses paid. An appeal was later allowed finding that the motions judge lacked jurisdiction. A motion for contempt was scheduled but was adjourned and a telephone conference was held instead.A motion related to a dispute between the Salt River First Nation and Royal Trust/RBC Investments was heard in Fort Smith Northwest Territories in July 2004.
