The plaintiff seeks an interlocutory injunction to prevent the defendant from selling a baby stroller named Huggable until the dispute between the parties is resolved at trial. An interim injunction was previously granted after the defendant was found to have made an almost perfect copy of the plaintiff's stroller. The defendant sought to reactivate the application for an interlocutory injunction but this was opposed by the plaintiff. The case involves allegations of copyright infringement and infringement of an industrial design registration.The case involves alleged infringement of an industrial design registration for a stroller. The defendant denies copying the design but a visual inspection of the two strollers suggests otherwise. The issue is whether there is substantial similarity between the designs. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's industrial design registration is invalid but this is not the main issue. The court finds considerable visual similarity between the strollers and rules that the defendant's stroller infringes the plaintiff's design.
