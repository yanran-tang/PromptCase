This case involves an application for judicial review seeking to revoke a peremptory request for payment under s. 224(1) of the Income Tax Act which requires a third party Financi√®re Manuvie to pay the Receiver General 30% of the wages or salary owing to the tax debtor. The applicant argues that the garnishment of her annuity is an intrusion on an activity affecting property and civil rights which falls within the jurisdiction of the provinces. However the court rules that s. 224(1) of the Act which allows the Department to garnish third parties is authorized by s. 91(3) of the Constitution Act 1867 and therefore has a genuine self-sufficiency in relation to private law overriding provincial laws exempting annuities from seizure.
