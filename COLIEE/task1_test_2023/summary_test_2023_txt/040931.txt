The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board that denied the applicants' claims of refugee protection based on the alleged risk of extortion and kidnapping by organized criminal gang members in Guatemala. The Board found that the applicants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The Court dismissed the application finding that the Board's decision was reasonable and that the applicants had failed to establish that they were personally targeted by criminal gangs or members of a particular social group.
