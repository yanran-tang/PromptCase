The case concerns an unopposed appeal by VÃªtement Multi-Wear Inc. against a decision of the Registrar of Trade-Marks to expunge its trade-mark L'AMADEI from the Trade-marks Register due to a failure to provide evidence of use within three years. The Court found that Multi-Wear provided sufficient evidence of use through invoices and an affidavit and therefore set aside the Registrar's decision and maintained the trade-mark on the register but only in respect of ladies' clothing such as pants skirts dresses and blouses.
