In this case the applicants who are Chilean citizens and have lived in Canada since 1978 seek judicial review of a decision to execute their deportation on the grounds of their failed refugee claims. They seek relief from the court to set aside the decision declare certain provisions of the Immigration Act that support their removal unconstitutional and enjoin the respondent from removing them until they no longer face the risk of cruel and unusual treatment in Chile. The applicants have a complicated history of legal battles surrounding their immigration status in Canada.In 1995 two Chilean applicants were ordered to be deported from Canada due to expired permits. They were granted a stay of execution when they claimed they were human rights activists who feared persecution in Chile after assisting in exposing abuses by the Chilean police. The applicants also claimed that an RCMP investigation in 1986 confirmed that their lives would be in danger if they returned. The court considered their allegations and testimony but ultimately dismissed their application for judicial review in 1997.This is a court case involving a deportation order where the judge is considering whether there was an error in the decision-making process. The judge is also considering whether certain affidavits submitted by the appellants can be used as evidence and whether the s. 44 of the Federal Court Act should be applied to suspend the execution of the deportation orders. The case involves discussing several legal issues including Charter rights violations and the availability of appropriate remedies.
