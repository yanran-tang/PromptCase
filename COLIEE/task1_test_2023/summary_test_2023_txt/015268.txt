The defendant in a patent infringement case has applied to strike paragraph 6 of the plaintiff's statement of claim arguing that it fails to provide a precise statement of material facts by which the defendant has infringed the claims of the patent. The court agrees and grants the application with costs to the defendant. The plaintiff is given leave to file an amended statement of claim within 30 days.
