The applicants sought leave to apply for a stay of a departure notice issued against them on the basis that they did not have a credible basis for their claim to be convention refugees. The court dismissed the application for a stay finding that there was no evidence of irreparable harm to the applicants if the process arising from the departure notice was not stayed and that the public interest supported the maintenance of statutory programs. The court urged that the applicants not be compelled to leave Canada before completing their respective school years.
