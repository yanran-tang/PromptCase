This case is about an application for judicial review of a decision by Immigration Officer Brian W. Huzel who denied an application for permanent residence status from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The applicants allege that the officer erred by requiring them to show unique hardship and failing to consider the best interests of the children. The officer found there were insufficient grounds to exempt the applicants from applying for permanent residence status from outside Canada and the applicants seek to have the decision set aside.The court upheld the decision made by an immigration officer to reject a Humanitarian and Compassionate (H&C) application on the basis that the applicant's child who was born in Canada had not developed strong ties to Canadian society and culture. The court noted that it cannot consider new evidence not presented to the decision-maker and that the appropriate course for the applicants was to file a new H&C application or request the original application to be reopened. The court upheld the standard of review as reasonableness simpliciter.
