Allan MacDonald sought a judicial review of a decision by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) to transfer him further from his community and family than the institution to which he was originally assigned. MacDonald was serving a life sentence for the first-degree murder of an off-duty police officer in Ontario. The transfer was allegedly made on the basis of community complaints and associations opposed to his presence at Fenbrook Institution. The court found that the decision to transfer Mr. MacDonald was made arbitrarily and without support of any legal or policy criterion annulling the transfer order.
