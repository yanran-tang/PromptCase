This case involves a challenge to an election of the Salt River First Nation 195 council. The applicants argue that the election was not conducted properly and seek an order quashing the results declaring themselves as duly elected and enjoining the respondents from acting as council members. The Salt River First Nation 195 is an aboriginal band located in Fort Smith NT and had recently entered into a settlement agreement with the Government of Canada concerning Treaty Land Entitlement. The settlement had been in negotiation for several years.The Council extended its term to ensure continuity for the agreement until elections in August 2002. After the elections Chief Victor Marie appointed his sister Jeannie Marie Jewell as interim band administrator who allegedly acted without Council authorization. The Council voted to terminate her position but Chief Victor Marie failed to respect the decision and refused to leave. A resolution to remove the chief was formally introduced and passed leading to a meeting on November 3 2002 to remove him.
