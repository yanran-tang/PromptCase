The Dairy Processors Association of Canada (DPAC) has taken legal action against the Dairy Farmers of Canada (DFC) for five trade-mark applications and has been refused leave to amend its statements of opposition in each case. The differences between the marks filed are not relevant to the case and DPAC's requests for leave to amend its Statements of Opposition were refused by the Trade-marks Opposition Board. However the Federal Court ruled that the Member had erred and the decisions should be set aside.The case involves DPAC Technologies seeking to amend their statement of opposition in a trademark dispute with DFC Holdings. The member of the opposition board denied DPAC's request to amend citing late timing and potential prejudice to DFC. DPAC argues that judicial review is necessary due to the lack of an adequate remedy at the end of the opposition proceedings. The main issues are whether the decisions are subject to judicial review and if the member erred in refusing the amendment.
