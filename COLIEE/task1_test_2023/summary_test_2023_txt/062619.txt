Ms. Wendy Price is seeking judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision not to deal with her complaint against Concord Transportation Inc. alleging sexual discrimination. Price claimed that the company did not hire her driver Steve Love because he was employed by a female truck owner. However the Commission could not assist her as her complaint did not fall under the grounds of discrimination it investigates as defined by the Canadian Human Rights Act.This is a summary of a legal case where an applicant accused Concord Transportation Inc. of discrimination in denying her husband Steve Love a driving position. The Canadian Human Rights Commission received the complaint after the applicant's appeal to the Ontario Human Rights Commission. The Respondent raised the issue of timeliness and prejudice but it was allowed to proceed. The Respondent claimed it would be prejudiced because witnesses were no longer employed to investigate an event that happened more than three years before.
