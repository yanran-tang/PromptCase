Professional poker player Benjamin Travis Tollerene brought an application for a judicial review after being denied permanent residency under the self-employed person class by the consulate general of Canada in Los Angeles. The officer denied the application under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and found that Tollerene failed to meet the definition of a self-employed person. The application for judicial review was dismissed as the officer's decision fell within the range of acceptable outcomes.
