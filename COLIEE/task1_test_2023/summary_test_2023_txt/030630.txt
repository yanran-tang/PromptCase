A request by John E. Canning Ltd for the consolidation or simultaneous hearing of two lawsuits it brought against Tripap Inc and McKeil Marine Ltd respectively has been dismissed by the Federal Court of Canada. Canning had argued that the two lawsuits featured common legal and factual issues. The court concluded there were disparities in legal and factual issues and trials would not be simplified through consolidation. Canning had also sought an order from the court to stay the hearing of the McKeil action pending the determination of its lawsuit against Tripap but this request was also dismissed.
