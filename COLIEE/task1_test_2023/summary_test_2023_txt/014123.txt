A family from Mexico challenged a decision by a member of the Refugee Protection Division who had determined they were not Convention Refugees nor persons in need of protection. The applicants were represented by Alyssa Manning while Nimanthika Kaneira represented the respondent. Counsel for the applicants raised three principal issues in their challenge to the decision. In their Personal Information Form the principal applicant an accountant in Mexico City claimed that a Judicial Police officer had threatened him and his family if he refused to pay for past sales.In a tribunal decision it was ruled that Mr. Munoz who fled Mexico due to extortion from a corrupt police officer did not qualify for protection under the Convention against Torture. The focus was on section 97 of IRPA which states that a person in need of protection is someone at risk of torture or cruel treatment in their home country. While some aspects of Mr. Munoz's testimony were believed the tribunal found parts of his story hard to believe.
