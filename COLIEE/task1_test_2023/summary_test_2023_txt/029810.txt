This is a judicial review of the Immigration and Refugee Board's decision where the respondent a citizen of Eritrea who was forcibly recruited into the Ethiopian military was determined to be a Convention refugee. The main issue was whether the Board erred in law in determining the respondent to not be complicit in war crimes and ignoring his failure to disassociate himself at the earliest opportunity. The Act defines a Convention refugee as someone to whom the Convention applies and the Board considered whether the respondent fell within this definition.The case involves a claim for refugee status by an individual who is excluded from the application of the Convention due to serious reasons for considering that they have committed a crime against peace a war crime or a crime against humanity. The applicant argues that the respondent was complicit in committing crimes against humanity by assisting the military in the war against Eritrea participating in deliberate inhumanity. The Federal Court of Appeal explains that the burden of establishing serious reasons for considering such international offences had been committed lies with the applicant and that the degree of complicity required for accomplices is less than the balance of probabilities requiring a knowing state of mind.d be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account factors such as shared common purpose and knowledge membership in a participating group and personal involvement in the commission of acts declared criminal by international law. Mere presence at the scene of a crime or membership in an organization that commits international offenses is not normally sufficient for exclusion from refugee status unless the individual is personally implicated in the commission of criminal acts. It is also important to avoid condemning automatically everyone engaged in conflict under conditions of war.
