Bijoya Chakrabarty a citizen of Bangladesh and of the Hindu faith applied for refugee protection in Canada. After her claim was denied by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board she applied for a Pre-Risk Removal Assessment which found her not to be at risk. Chakrabarty then applied for a judicial review of the assessment claiming that she was at risk of persecution by extremist members of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamat-e-Islami. The assessment officer found that while there was evidence of violence against members of the Hindu minority in Bangladesh Chakrabarty did not face personal or generalized risk to justify refugee protection. The court dismissed the application for judicial review.
