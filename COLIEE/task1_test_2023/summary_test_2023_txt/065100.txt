Ms. Ched a Cambodian citizen claimed that her husband and two sons were arrested falsely by the Cambodian National Police and that her family has disappeared. However the Refugee Protection Division panel found her testimony to be inconsistent implausible and unlikely. The panel added that Ms. Ched never initiated any inquiries in Canada to find out what happened to her family and that she did not demonstrate that she made any effort to do so. Therefore the panel determined that Ms. Ched was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.
