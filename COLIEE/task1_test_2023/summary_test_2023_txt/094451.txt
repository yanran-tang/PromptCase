The Canadian Football League (CFL) submitted a brief to the Canadian government with proposals for legislative action. When a request for information was made under the Access to Information Act the government decided to release the brief with redactions. The CFL applied for a review of this decision but the application was dismissed and the brief was partially disclosed.The Canadian Football League (C.F.L.) objected to the disclosure of a brief and argued that it was not considered as a record under the control of a government institution. The brief contained financial and commercial information but the C.F.L. claimed that its disclosure would result in financial loss or prejudice the competitive position of the applicants. The hearing was set for December 15 1988 but the C.F.L.'s motion record was not filed until December 13 1988 and it was incomplete. David Shoalts a journalist at the Globe and Mail newspaper participated in the review proceeding.
