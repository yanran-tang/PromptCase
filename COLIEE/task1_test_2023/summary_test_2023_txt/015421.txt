Eli Lilly seeks an order from the Canadian courts preventing the Minister of National Health and Welfare from issuing Novopharm with a Notice of Compliance for the production of fluoxetine hydrochloride capsules until after the expiration of Canadian Letters Patent 1051034 on 19 March 1996. NovopharmÂ has claimed that its suppliers do not use the same process as Lilly for the production of fluoxetine with both parties providing evidence to the court. The Lilly Patent relates to the process for preparing 3-aryloxy-3-phenylpropylamine compounds.esis of fluoxetine hydrochloride which involves reacting NN-dimethyl 3-phenyl-3-chloropropylamine with p-trifluoromethylphenol demethylating and forming the hydrochloride salt. Claim 5 claims the same process but specifically for N-methyl 3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylamine hydrochloride. Claims 2 and 6 are product-by-process claims covering compounds of a specific formula and their acid addition salts when prepared by the process claimed in claims 1 and 5 or an equivalent process.This is a discussion about the synthesis of fluoxetine hydrochloride. The Lilly patent claims a process with six steps but only the last three are actually claimed. The Fermion process is also mentioned which involves a five-step synthetic pathway that is different from the process claimed in the Lilly patent. Dr. Fallis provides detailed descriptions of both processes in his affidavit.The Court of Appeal examined the legislative framework provided for by the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations and the Food and Drug Regulations. The framework introduced a new regime to preserve the monopoly rights of the patentee of a medicine where a medicine cannot be marketed in Canada without a Notice of Compliance issued by the Minister. The scheme allows drug manufacturers to file a patent list in respect of each drug for which they hold or obtain a Notice of Compliance.
