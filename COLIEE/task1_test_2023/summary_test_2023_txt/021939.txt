This is a case of judicial review of a decision by the Tribunal regarding abuse of authority in the hiring process for two positions at the Department of Justice Canada's Tax Litigation Directorate in Montreal. Parliament's intent as stated in the preamble of the Public Service Employment Act 2003 c. 22 ss.12 and 13 affords managers broad discretion with staffing. The Court does not have the jurisdiction to determine essential qualifications but rather to assess abuse of authority in the way the assessment board assessed the applications. Certain essential qualifications were clarified in a document provided to those in charge of screening. The definitions for these qualifications were signed by the director on or about September 22 2006 but dated September 8 2006 which was the approximate time that they were created.Jean Lavigne a lawyer with 30 years of experience applied for two positions with the Canadian government in 2006 but was rejected due to lacking experience in conducting complex and varied civil litigation before the Tax Court of Canada. After receiving an email stating he did not meet essential qualifications he was given a document outlining essential qualifications and selection criteria which included recent experience dealing with the Income Tax Act and the Employment Insurance Act. Lavigne filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal alleging discrimination based on age and disability.The case involves Mr. Lavigne who filed complaints with the Tribunal after being eliminated from a pool of candidates for appointment to the position of case presenting officer with the Canada Revenue Agency. The Tribunal denied Mr. Lavigne's complaints stating that the assessment board did not abuse their authority in eliminating him from the competition and that the allegations of forgery did not vitiate the entire process.
