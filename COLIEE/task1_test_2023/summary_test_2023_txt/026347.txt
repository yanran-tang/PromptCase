This is an application for judicial review of the Immigration and Refugee Board's Immigration Appeal Division's decision which refused to entertain the applicant's appeal on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of sections 64 and 190 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The applicant Mr. Kroon has been a permanent resident of Canada since 1972 but has never applied for or been granted Canadian citizenship. He was ruled to be inadmissible to Canada on grounds of serious criminality and ordered removed from Canada. Kroon challenged the constitutional validity applicability or operability of the impugned sections.The IAD had dismissed an appeal against a deportation order issued on the applicant claiming it did not have the jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges against the IRPA. The applicant's attempts to set aside the decision failed resulting in his removal from Canada to the Netherlands. The applicant argued that the language of the IRPA did not expressly limit the IAD's jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges but the court ultimately rejected this argument.
