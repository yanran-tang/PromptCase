An Indian citizen and a Sikh faith follower appealed a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division that he was not a refugee. He claimed that he was beaten and harassed by the police due to his perceived political opinion. The board accepted his identity but found parts of his story to be implausible. However the court found that the board ignored or misunderstood some key pieces of evidence rendering their decision patently unreasonable. The application for judicial review was allowed and the matter was returned for reconsideration.
