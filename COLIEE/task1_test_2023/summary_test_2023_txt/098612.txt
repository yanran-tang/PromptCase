Gabor Szorenyi a citizen of Hungary and a homosexual applied for refugee status in Canada claiming persecution in Hungary. However the Immigration and Refugee Board found that there was no evidence to support his claim and rejected it prompting Gabor to seek judicial review. In the review the court found that the Board's decision was reasonable since Gabor did not provide clear and convincing proof that state protection was unavailable and that the Board's finding on the overall situation of homosexuals in Hungary was also reasonable.
