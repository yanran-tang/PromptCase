This case is about an importer and retailer of apparel YM seeking to amend import permits under the Export and Import Permits Act to classify goods as TPL goods which allows for a remission of duties. The imports were manufactured in the US and although cut sewn and assembled there YM now believes the goods were made from fabric and yarn originating outside of North America thus requiring amendments to the permits. This case involves provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement and its implementation and administration in Canada.The case involves YM Inc. seeking amended import permits to classify goods as TPL goods which are subject to certain import restrictions and quotas under NAFTA. However the Minister of International Trade denies the request citing a lack of evidence to prove eligibility for TPL benefits. YM Inc. challenges the decision on jurisdictional grounds and argues that the Minister's policy improperly fettered his discretion.A policy of denying retroactive tariff preferences under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been found to be operational despite denial by senior officials of the Canadian government. The policy was disclosed in letters to a customs broker asking for amended import permits which stated that retroactive third-party logistics is not available if an incorrect declaration had not been voluntarily amended prior to Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) action. However the decision raises doubts over whether the policy is universally applied.
