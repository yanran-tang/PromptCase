Nicola Del Vecchio who is currently serving a prison term of 15 years and 8 months in the United States for conspiring to distribute narcotics has sought judicial review after the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness refused to transfer him to serve the remainder of his sentence in Canada. Del Vecchio argues that the Minister erred in failing to consider the treatment accorded to his co-conspirators some of whom have been permitted to serve portions of their sentences in Canada. An assessment by the Correctional Service of Canada found that there was no reason to believe that Del Vecchio's return to Canada would pose a threat to the security of Canada or that he would thereafter commit an act of terrorism. The Federal Court found the Minister's decision to be unreasonable and has remitted Del Vecchio's application for transfer to the Minister for reconsideration.The Canadian Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness denied a transfer request from a Canadian citizen Stefano Del Vecchio who is currently serving a 22-year sentence for drug trafficking in the United States. The decision was made due to Del Vecchio's possible affiliation with the Rizzuto crime family and his links to a criminal organization of Columbian origin. The decision rested on the interpretation of the International Transfer of Offenders Act which allows for Canadians serving sentences abroad to request transfer to Canada.
