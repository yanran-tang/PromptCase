This case involves an appeal under section 56 of the Trade-marks Act for the registration of the trademark NORDIC & Snowflake Design for use in association with tires. The opposition was filed by the owner of the trademark NORDIQUES who alleged that the proposed trademark was not compliant with the Act confusing with their registered trademark and not distinctive. The Registrar of Trademarks upheld the opposition and the applicant filed a statutory appeal with new evidence. The issues for consideration are whether the proposed trademark is registrable under section 12(1)(d) and whether it is distinctive under section 2 of the Act.In the case of trademark opposition the onus of proof falls on the person seeking registration of the new trademark to prove that it is unlikely to cause confusion with an existing trademark. The applicable standard of proof is that of a balance of probabilities and the determination of whether a mark is likely to be confusing is a question of opinion based on the circumstances and facts of the case. The material date for considering the issue of distinctiveness is the date of filing the statement of opposition while registrability is assessed as of the date of the decision. The Act defines confusion as the use of both trademarks in the same area leading to the inference that the goods or services associated with them are manufactured or sold by the same person. The Registrar should consider all surrounding circumstances including the distinctiveness and extent of use of the trademarks or tradenames. The standard of reviewing decisions of the Registrar without new evidence is reasonableness.
