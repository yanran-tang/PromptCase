Canadian farmers have filed a class-action lawsuit against the Farm Credit Corporation the Farm Debt Review Board and a minister in an attempt to obtain disclosure of policies and regulations during negotiations regarding outstanding loans. The farmers claim they were treated unfairly and misled by the Corporation and are seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the auction or sale of their farms until the disclosure is provided. The defendants have presented a motion to strike the claim.Rule 1711 of the Federal Court Rules allows numerous individuals with a common interest and grievance to pursue a class action. However the relief sought must have a practical impact on all members. In the case of farmers who have borrowed from the F.C.C. the plaintiffs' proposed class includes those at varying stages of dealing with the institution whose interests differ and therefore their relief sought cannot form the subject matter of a class action.
