The plaintiff requested to write off an amount owed to the Department of Human Resources Development Canada as an overpayment of employment insurance benefits. The decision by the regional recovery officer denied the request so the plaintiff brought an application for judicial review to intervene in the Commission's decision. The court ruled in the plaintiff's favor stating that the decision-maker ignored relevant factors and did not exercise discretion judicially. The matter was referred back to the Commission for re-consideration by another decision-maker taking into account the findings of fact made by the board of referees and the umpire.
