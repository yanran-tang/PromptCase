The case concerns the quality of evidence submitted to the registrar of trade-marks for giving public notice of an official mark under the Trade-Marks Act. The Electrical Safety Authority applied for registration of the mark DIG SAFE as an official mark and the Registrar granted the application on the basis of documentary evidence of adoption and use in a newsletter. Cable Control Systems Inc. which had received registration of the trade-mark DIG SAFE & Design objected to the publication of the official mark arguing that ESA did not meet the onus to establish its adoption and use of the official mark. The court found that the additional evidence would not have had a material effect on the Registrar's decision and that it was reasonable for the Registrar to accept the newsletter as evidence of ESA's adoption and use of the official mark.
