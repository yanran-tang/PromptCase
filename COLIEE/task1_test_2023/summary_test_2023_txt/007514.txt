The case involves a Nigerian citizen who made a refugee claim in Canada that was suspended to assess his admissibility based on organized criminality. The Minister applied for non-disclosure of certain information in relation to the case which the Immigration Division allowed in part. The Federal Court granted a non-disclosure order for some of the information which was obtained from a confidential source and therefore its disclosure would be injurious to that person's safety.
