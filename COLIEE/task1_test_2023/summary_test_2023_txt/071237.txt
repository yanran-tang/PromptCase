This case involves a mother and her daughter from South Africa seeking refugee status in Canada due to fears of persecution in South Africa and Nigeria. The Immigration and Refugee Board denied their claim finding the applicant lacked credibility and failed to show that state protection was unavailable. The applicant filed an application for judicial review alleging bias and misconduct by the Board. However the court found no evidence of bias or misconduct and dismissed the application.
