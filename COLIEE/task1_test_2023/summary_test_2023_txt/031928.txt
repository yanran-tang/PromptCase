The appellant appealed a decision made by the Registrar of Trade-marks that refused an application for registration of the trademark FRUIT DOTS for breakfast cereals. The Registrar found the trademark to be confusing with the already registered trademark FROOT LOOPS. The relevant legislation specifically Section 6(2) and 6(5) of the Trade-marks Act were considered in determining the issue of confusion.gistrar made an error in finding that the appellant's trademark FRUIT DOTS was confusing with the respondent's trademark FROOT LOOPS and appeals the decision. The Act outlines the criteria for trademark registration including the period of use the nature of the goods or services and the degree of similarity between trademarks. Section 56 of the Act provides a broad right of appeal to the Federal Court allowing for additional evidence to be presented and for the court to exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar.
