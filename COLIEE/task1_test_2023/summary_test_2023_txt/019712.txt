The plaintiff seeks relief from the court to strike out certain paragraphs of the Amended Statement of Defence order the defendants to provide affidavits of documents for discovery and to be available for oral examinations for discovery. The grounds for the motion include res judicata and an issue estoppel against the defendants. The issue at hand concerns the concern for religious or ethnic background of Canadian citizens who may be selected for peacekeeping duties in the Canadian Forces or the Department of National Defence.Canada's Constitution upholds secularity and protects freedoms of conscience religion thought belief opinion expression and equality without discrimination making it emphatically not a theocracy. Although certain educational guarantees based on religion were constitutionally entrenched there were no further religious distinctions or guarantees. This secularity is important to extend equal protection to all citizens. While some religions and philosophies may be inimical to Canada's constitutional imperatives they are prosecutable in the country. The respondent must protect individual members of the Canadian Forces abroad and their missions abroad while considering racial or religious considerations.The case involves a member of the forces who alleges they were put at undue risk due to the respondent's policy. Two defendants the Minister of National Defence and the Chief of the Defence Staff moved to include the Queen as a defendant and strike out certain parts of the plaintiff's claim. The motion was unsuccessful and the plaintiff's claim remained intact. An intervener filed a motion seeking participation in the litigation. The plaintiff alleges certain paragraphs of the defendant's statement of defence are abusive of the court's process.
