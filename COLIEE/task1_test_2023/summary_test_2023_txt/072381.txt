The case involves an applicant who was granted a stay of deportation with a condition to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of five years. However the applicant committed 18 driving offenses during this period resulting in the cancellation of the stay under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The court found that the decision was made in reviewable error as the wrong section was applied and set aside the decision.
