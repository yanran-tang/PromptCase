The family of four from Ethiopia challenged the decision of a single member of the Immigration and Refugee Board who held that they were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The male applicant Sida feared persecution after making adverse comments about Ethiopia's human rights record and opposing the war against Eritrea while serving as a senior official at the Ethiopian Embassy in Rome. The court found that the member erred in rejecting any consideration of country conditions and that there were findings which were patently unreasonable. The decision was quashed and remitted back to the Board.
