The Queen in Right of Canada is appealing an order by Prothonotary Hargrave that denied a motion to strike out the plaintiff's Statement of Claim and declaratory relief. The defendant argues that the discretionary order was based on a misapprehension of facts or a wrong principle and two related court proceedings involving a fishing vessel are discussed in detail. The case revolves around the transfer of certain fishing licenses and the lawfulness of this transfer.Radil purchased a fishing vessel but later found out that the vessel's IVQ allocation was based on someone else's catch history. After requesting a correction from the DFO and receiving no response Radil initiated legal proceedings seeking a declaration that they were entitled to the correct IVQ allocation based on their own catch history. The court rejected a motion to strike out the case ordered it to proceed as an action and later dismissed a motion for summary judgment.The case involves a plaintiff who filed two separate proceedings against the same parties seeking declaratory relief and damages based on the same factual circumstances. The court ordered that both actions be heard together as they arise in respect of the same transactions. The defendant Her Majesty the Queen sought to strike out the plaintiff's Statement of Claim but the motions were denied by Prothonotary Hargrave. The defendant then filed a motion to strike the plaintiff's amended Statement of Claim which was set for a case management conference.
