The plaintiff in a maritime claim failed to serve a Statement of Claim against a vessel and three sister ships. Two ex parte extension orders were granted without prejudice to an owner applying to set them aside. The defendant owner of the sister ship Clymene provided an affidavit to show that the Clymene had been in the port of Vancouver for some weeks after the Statement of Claim was filed in Vancouver. The court ultimately removed the Clymene from the action. The plaintiff was ordered to pay costs at the maximum under column IV of Tariff B.
