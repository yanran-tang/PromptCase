This case involves a fisherman in Newfoundland and Labrador who claims he unknowingly transferred his groundfish license to the buyer of his vessel in 1990. His request for reinstatement of his supplementary crab license was denied by the Fisheries and Oceans Minister in 2001. Following a positive recommendation from the Appeal Board to reinstate the license the fisherman sought judicial review of the Minister's decision.Mr. Smith contended that the acquisition of a new groundfish license by the applicant resulted in forfeiting eligibility to hold a supplementary crab license. However it was difficult to confirm what details were communicated to the applicant during the transfer of licenses. The applicant's legal counsel presented a case for the applicant stating that he lacked education and was not advised about transferring his groundfish license while selling his vessel.An applicant believed he still held a license which had been transferred to someone else but he could not use it because he didn't have a boat that was larger than 35 feet. He thought that if he kept his supplementary crab licence and did not use it the licence would be revoked. The Appeal Board recommended that his appeal be allowed and his supplementary crab licence be reinstated.
