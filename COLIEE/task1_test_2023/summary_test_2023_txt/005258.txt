The case involves an application for a judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) rejecting the applicant's claim for Convention refugee status. The applicant Lina Li claimed a well-founded fear of persecution based on her selling of banned Falun Gong literature. The RPD dismissed her claim due to insufficient evidence of her identity and fear of persecution. The court upheld the RPD's decision as the inconsistencies in the evidence given by the applicant provided a sufficient basis for the decision.
