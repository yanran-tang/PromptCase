Mr. Blanco a citizen of Colombia applied for refugee protection in Canada due to persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) because of his perceived political opinion as an officer in the Colombian Navy. The Refugee Protection Division found him to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection but excluded him based on Section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration argued that Mr. Blanco was complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Colombian armed forces including the navy and naval intelligence. The Federal Court eventually found that the RPD's conclusion that Mr. Blanco was complicit in international crimes was patently unreasonable and could not be sustained and therefore allowed the application for judicial review.
