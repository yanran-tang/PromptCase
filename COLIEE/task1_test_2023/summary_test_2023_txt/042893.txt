This case concerns an application for judicial review of the Registrar of Trade-marks' decision to publish notice of adoption and use of the mark ICEWINE by Vintners Quality Alliance of Canada. The focus is on official marks for which there are no objection or appeal proceedings. The case was consolidated with other applications by wine producers but VQA withdrew its claim to the official marks just before the hearing.In 2001 the Magnotta group of companies filed an application for judicial review seeking to overturn the Registrar's decision to accept the mark ICEWINE as an official mark used by VQA. Magnotta argued that they had been using the mark since 1991 and the registration by VQA would cause confusion in the market. The case dealt only with the legal merits of Magnotta's application and was ultimately decided in their favor.Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) was established by wineries in Ontario to work with government bodies in creating and implementing standards for Canadian wines. VQA members were required to comply with the organization's rules and regulations including standards for quality assurance. VQA marks were also adopted by the British Columbia Wine Institute and joint efforts were made to develop national wine standards. The Vintners Quality Alliance Act was later passed in Ontario to establish an appellation of origin system for wines produced in the province administered by a new corporation Vintners Quality Alliance of Ontario (VQAO).
