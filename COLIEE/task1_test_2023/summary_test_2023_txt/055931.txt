The summary judgment application brought by defendants accuses the plaintiff of infringing on their registered trademark Personal Alternative and seeks the expungement of the plaintiff's trademarks damages for infringement and passing off injunction accounting for profits surrender of infringing materials and ancillary relief. The plaintiff denies any acquiescence and argues that this is not an appropriate case for summary judgment. The court will consider the evidence and determine if there are factual issues that require assessment and weighing of evidence that should be done by a trier of fact.Â A legal dispute between funeral businesses in Ontario and British Columbia over the use of certain trademarks will be decided on affidavit evidence before the opposition board. The Canadian Federal Court of Appeal has ruled that there is no need for a trial at this stage. The case concerns the use of the Simple Alternative trademark in British Columbia claimed by a funeral service there and its registration by a business in Ontario.The affidavit evidence given by Mr. Little indicates that representatives from Commemorative Services of Ontario including Mr. Eric Tappenden expressed interest in Personal Alternative's alternative funeral services despite their company only offering limited services at the time. Mr. Atkinson one of the representatives also previously ran his own alternative funeral business before joining The Simple Alternative.In 1993 the defendant in a case received positive feedback from a meeting with Eric Tappenden and Dan Atkinson who were representatives of The Simple Alternative funeral services. The defendant was praised for their low-cost alternative service and received promotional material from The Simple Alternative to assist in their business. No complaints were made about the use of the name Personal Alternative.
