he case concerns a decision by an immigration officer to refuse permanent landing to an applicant under the Refugee Claims Backlog Regulations prompting the applicant to seek a new hearing. The regulations were enacted in 1986 to deal with a massive backlog of individuals claiming refugee status in Canada and the one-stop procedure adopted by the authorities granted permanent landing to those who were deemed to have become established in Canada or had the potential to do so. However the broad discretion given to immigration officers raised concerns about fairness and consistency in the application of the policy.n Canada if the applicant has a relative who is a Canadian citizen or permanent resident and who meets the requirements outlined in section 7(2). Additionally section 5 outlines factors that immigration officers use to determine if an applicant is successfully established in Canada or has the potential to become so such as stability in employment and education level. The overall goal of these regulations known as the Administrative Review Project is to ensure that judgment calls on immigration applications are as consistent as possible regardless of race color or creed.
