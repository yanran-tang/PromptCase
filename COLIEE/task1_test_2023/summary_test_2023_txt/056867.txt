This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision to deny a deferral of removal for the applicant pending the outcome of her application for judicial review of a negative pre-removal risk assessment. The applicant is a citizen of Guyana who made a refugee claim in Canada in 2003 which was subsequently denied. The applicant's PRRA application was also rejected and a decision on her judicial review is pending. The applicant requested a deferral of removal based on the pending judicial review but the request was denied by the enforcement officer. The applicant seeks to have the decision set aside and sent back for redetermination by a different decision-maker.An applicant requested a deferral of removal from Canada due to possible risks to her life and personal circumstances. The officer denied her request stating that there were no new risks beyond those claimed in her PRRA and that the applicant's claims of risk and undue hardship had already been adjudicated. The applicant questions the officer's decision based on several issues such as the officer's assertion that the litigation on the PRRA could be completed before the removal of the applicant and the applicant's right to a fulsome leave for judicial review and judicial review process. The appropriate standards of review and lack of procedural fairness are also questioned.
