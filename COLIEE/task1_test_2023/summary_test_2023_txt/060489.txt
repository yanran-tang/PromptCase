Contour Optik appealed a decision granting Hakim Optical's motion for additional security for costs in a patent infringement case involving magnetic clip-on sunglasses. Contour argued that the costs were excessive unreasonable and speculative but the court dismissed the appeal finding that the Senior Associate Prothonotary did not exercise his discretion based on an error of law or misapprehension of the facts. The court awarded costs of $1500 to Hakim.
