The Deer Lake Regional Authority Inc. appealed an order denying their request for materials related to their application for judicial review of the Canadian Border Services Agency's decision to refuse to designate their airport as an Airport of Entry. The appeal was dismissed by the Federal Court concluding that the order must be upheld. The Deer Lake Regional Authority Inc. sought full AOE designation to allow more frequent international flight arrivals at their airport.The Applicant argued that the Minister failed to establish objective criteria for granting Airport of Entry status and discriminated against the Applicant by allowing other airports to maintain such status without meeting the same criteria. The Applicant requested documents related to past designations of Airports of Entry and information on services offered at such airports. The Respondent objected to the production of these materials and the Prothonotary's Order upheld the objections except for one document. The Applicant filed an appeal on this decision.
