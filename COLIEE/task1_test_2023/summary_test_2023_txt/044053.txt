The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision to refuse a humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) application for permanent residence in Canada. The officer rejected the application on the basis that the applicant had not established his identity and had misled authorities. The applicant argued that the officer's conclusion was not supported by the CBSA's removal order and that the best interests of his children were not adequately considered. The court concluded that the officer's decision was reasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
