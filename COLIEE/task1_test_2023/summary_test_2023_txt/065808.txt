This case involves a judicial review to determine whether the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) lacked jurisdiction in hearing an appeal due to pre-sentence incarceration being deemed a credit of 34 months' imprisonment which would deprive the applicant of the right of appeal. The court concluded that the IAD had jurisdiction but made an unreasonable determination that the sentencing judge accepted a 2:1 credit. The IAD's decision was quashed and the matter was referred back to the IAD to proceed with the appeal in the usual manner.
