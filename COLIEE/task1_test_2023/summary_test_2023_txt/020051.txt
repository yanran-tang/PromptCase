A judicial review is being held to determine if journalist Robert Gordon and his employer the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation were wrongfully denied access to the hearings of the Board of Inquiry investigating the fires on the HMCS Chicoutimi. The CBC argues that the Board has been charged with quasi-judicial duties as they make findings of responsibility. The Minister disagrees stating that the Board does not establish liability and is conducting an internal inquiry behind closed doors as required by the Regulations.The Board of Inquiry was convened in 2004 to investigate the fires and casualties on the Canadian submarine HMCS Chicoutimi. The inquiry was conducted under section 45 of the National Defence Act and chapter 21 of the Queen's Regulations and Order for the Armed Forces with specific rules for investigating different types of claims. The Board was required to strike a balance between informing the public and protecting security privacy operational and international relations. The CBC applied to attend but the Board only allowed written submissions.
