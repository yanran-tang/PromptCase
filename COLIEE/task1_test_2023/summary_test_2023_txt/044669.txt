The applicants in a patent case seek an order requiring Apotex to produce sample of bulk azithromycin and its tablets as well as its Abbreviated New Drug Submission and Drug Master File. The applicants claim to hold exclusive rights to crystalline azithromycin dihydrate and its pharmaceutical composition while Apotex alleges that its tablets will not contain dihydrate. The applicants seek these samples to determine if Apotex's product breaches their patent.The case pertains to a request for disclosure of the full manufacturing process for a pharmaceutical product which the court found to be required for assessing an allegation of non-infringement in relation to a product-based patent. The court also referenced a mechanism available to compel the production of relevant information in an ANDS. The applicants submitted that Apotex had not provided sufficient information about its formulation potentially leading to a lack of justification for its allegation of non-infringement.
