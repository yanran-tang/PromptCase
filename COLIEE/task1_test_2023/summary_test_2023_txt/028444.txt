This is a judicial review of an immigration officer's decision to refuse a Sri Lankan Tamil's application for landing on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The applicant's claim for protection as a Convention refugee and subsequent requests were all rejected leading to his application for consideration on h & c grounds. The applicant contends that the IO breached her duty of fairness in considering extraneous information without allowing him an opportunity to address her concerns and in using outdated information to reach her decision. However the court ultimately concludes that the IO's decision was reasonable given the evidence before her.
