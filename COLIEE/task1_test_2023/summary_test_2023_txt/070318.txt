Mr. Sali Mulliqui is a Muslim and ethnic Albanian from Kosovo seeking asylum in Canada due to fear of persecution as a member of the LDK political party and for deserting during the Serbian invasion. The Immigration and Refugee Board denied his claim and he seeks judicial review citing biased actions by the Board unreasonable credibility findings and breach of duty of fairness. The hearing process is discussed as evidence for the alleged bias.The applicant claims that there is bias against him in the process of his refugee claim due to several factors including an allegedly abusive interview by an immigration officer the actions of a refugee protection officer (RPO) the conduct of a Board member during the hearing and the failure of the Board to include the transcript of the first hearing day in the record. However the test for a reasonable apprehension of bias must focus on the decision maker in this case the Board member who heard and decided the matter. The actions of other officials such as immigration officers and RPOs are not relevant to the allegation of bias against the Board member.
