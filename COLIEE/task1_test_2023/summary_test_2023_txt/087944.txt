The estate requested relief but the CRA denied their request for late-filing penalties for 2003 and 2007.gment the court reviews a dispute between the estate of a deceased taxpayer and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) regarding the cancellation of interest and penalties for late-filing of income tax returns. The CRA cancelled interest for the 2006 tax return but refused to cancel penalties for the 2003 and 2007 returns. The estate requested a review of the decision but the CRA denied the request due to the failure to demonstrate circumstances preventing timely filing. The judgment includes relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act and concludes by dismissing the estate's appeal. The judgment is summarized in more than 50 words due to the complexity of the case.
