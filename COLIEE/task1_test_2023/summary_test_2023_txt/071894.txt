eal Instruments Inc. is being accused by Rivard Instruments Inc. of infringing the latter's Canadian patent for a detectable hypodermic needle device. In response Ideal denies infringement and cites two US patents it holds for its D3 Needle. A pre-trial protective order has been granted to Ideal by Madam Prothonotary Tabib to keep confidential information regarding the two US patents under Counsel's Eyes Only protection based on Ideal's evidence that disclosure could harm its commercial interests and competitive position. Rivard is appealing the order arguing that it is clearly wrong but it fails to produce any evidence to support this claim.Ideal has initiated legal action against Rivard in the US alleging patent infringement. As part of the legal proceedings Ideal is required to provide similarly related documents to Rivard in both the US and Canada prompting concerns over the confidential nature of sensitive information. Ideal requested a protective order from the Canadian court but Rivard refused to consent to the order with Ideal fearing that without such an order their production of documents could undermine the US court's order.
