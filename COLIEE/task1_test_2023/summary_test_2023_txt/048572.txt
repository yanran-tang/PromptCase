This is a case of an application for judicial review of the Immigration and Refugee Board's decision that the applicants who are all citizens of Hungary with Romani ethnicity were not Convention refugees. The female applicant and her three sons claimed a well-founded fear of persecution based on their ethnicity while the male applicant and his common-law spouse claimed persecution due to their association with their Romani spouses. The Board reviewed the incidents but ultimately found the applicants not to be refugees.Two Roma individuals had applied for refugee status in Canada due to faced discrimination in Hungary. However the Board found that the acts of discrimination did not amount to persecution and that Hungary had adequate state protection available for them. The applicants asked for a judicial review claiming that the Board failed to consider the impact of other documented acts of persecution underestimated the denial of employment and education as a violation of human rights and applied too onerous a burden on them to find state protection.
