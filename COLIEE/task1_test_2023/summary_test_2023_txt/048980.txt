The Federal Court allowed an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board due to a lack of natural justice. The Board identified a specific issue of concern the delay in claiming protection and did not provide counsel with an opportunity to respond to concerns about an internal flight alternative. The decision must be set aside as the applicant was denied natural justice.
