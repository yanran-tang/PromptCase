The applicants were seeking to set aside an order made by Strayer on February 17 1994 which denied their notice of motion to extend time to seek judicial review under the Immigration Act. Strayer dismissed the application stating that the materials submitted as a belated reply did not convince him an extension should be granted and that there was no right of reply under rule 324.
