nd day of hearing took place on January 10 2005 but the Applicants argued that they were not given a fair hearing due to various scheduling difficulties and delays. The court found that while the delays were unfortunate there was no evidence that the Board's handling of the case was unfair or biased.The court heard arguments from the Applicants who claimed that they were not given a fair hearing due to the Board's improper treatment and abusive questioning. However the court found that there was no evidence that the panel was the cause of scheduling difficulties or acted in bad faith. Furthermore the Board's questioning did not meet the test for a reasonable apprehension of bias. There was also no demonstrated link between the alleged mistreatment and prejudice to the Applicants.
