The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board to deny refugee status to two applicants who claimed to be at risk of violence due to a blood feud with a rival family in Albania. The court finds that the Board's credibility findings were not unreasonable but that the Board erred in failing to consider certain evidence related to state protection and remands the matter for re-determination.
