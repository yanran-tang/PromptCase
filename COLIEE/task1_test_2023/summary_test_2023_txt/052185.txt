The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration's request for judicial review of an appeal by Talwinder Singh Sohal from a refusal to approve a sponsored application for landing made by Manjit Singh Sohal was denied. The Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board allowed the appeal and the Federal Court of Canada Trial Division found that the presiding officer made no error in determining that Manjit was adopted within the meaning of the term and that the relationship of parent and child was created as a result of that adoption.
