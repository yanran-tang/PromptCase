The applicant applied for permanent residency in Canada as a Chef-Cook but was found to have no training or experience in the field. The visa officer deemed him qualified as an Assistant Manager Restaurant based on his training but since there was no demand for that occupation he received zero units of assessment. The application was denied without a personal interview as there was no indication of the necessary training or experience. The visa officer was not obligated to make further inquiries if an application was unclear. The applicant failed to apply for discretion under s. 11(3) of the Immigration Regulations. The judicial review was dismissed.
