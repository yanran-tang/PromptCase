The case involves Hungarian citizens of Roma heritage who claimed refugee status in Canada due to their mistreatment in their home country because of their ethnicity. However their claims were dismissed by the Immigration and Refugee Board on the basis that they failed to provide sufficient evidence and to show that state authorities in Hungary could not protect them. The applicants challenged the Board's decision but the court found no basis for overturning it and dismissed the application for judicial review.
