The plaintiff owns several registered trademarks relating to security systems and has been using the name Sentinel Alarm Co. since 1979. The defendant Mansoor Electronics Ltd. uses a similar trademark Home Sentinel & Design for wireless residential alarm systems. The main issue in the case is whether the defendant's trademark is causing confusion with the plaintiff's trademarks and whether it should be expunged from the register. Other issues raised in the original pleadings were abandoned during the trial.The use of a trademark or tradename causes confusion if it leads to the inference that the same person manufactures sells leases hires or performs the associated services or wares whether or not they are in the same general class. In determining whether confusion exists all surrounding circumstances must be considered including the distinctiveness and length of use of the trademarks the nature of the wares services or business the nature of the trade and the degree of resemblance between the trademarks or tradenames.
