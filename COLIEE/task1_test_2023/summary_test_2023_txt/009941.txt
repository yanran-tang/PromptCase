Mr. Francis Ramnauth and Mr. Allan Ramnauth claimed asylum in Canada after being threatened assaulted and robbed by political adversaries in Guyana. Their claims were joined with those of their wives and children before the Immigration and Refugee Board who dismissed both claims in a single set of reasons. A judicial review found that the Board erred in failing to provide separate analysis for each claim and has granted the request for a new hearing before a different panel.
