Rasalingam Arulraj had his request to stay in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds rejected by a Visa Officer. Although the Visa Officer considered the best interests of the two Canadian children in the end she did not believe their interests were sufficiently compelling to support his claim. Arulraj applied for permanent residence in Canada claiming spousal status but his claims were denied by the Visa Officer. The case was remitted to a different visa officer for re-consideration.
