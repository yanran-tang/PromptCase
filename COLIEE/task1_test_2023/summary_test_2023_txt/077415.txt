A panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board breached section 69(2) of the Immigration Act by excluding a female applicant from the hearing while her two children were questioned in her absence. The panel claimed that they excluded her to prevent her from influencing or signalling to the children but this was not a valid justification. The court ruled in favor of the applicant and the matter was remitted to a different panel for redetermination. It was certified for appeal whether the Refugee Division breached section 69(2) of the Immigration Act by hearing evidence from the minor children in the applicant's absence.
