The case involves Nam Tchougli Toligara Nazaire a citizen of Togo who claimed refugee status in Canada on the basis of his political opinion. His claim was denied and in his application for judicial review he argued that there was a breach of natural justice and that the officer erred in finding that he was not credible. The court rejected both arguments stating that the officer showed impartiality and that the applicant failed to establish a credible link between his claim and the objective situation prevailing in Togo.
