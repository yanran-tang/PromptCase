The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board (VRAB) concerning the entitlement of a pension for the surviving spouse of a veteran. The applicant argued that the VRAB's policy of only considering written arguments during the first step of the appeal process was inconsistent with the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Regulations. The court agreed stating that the applicant was entitled to make oral arguments and that the VRAB had erred in denying her that opportunity.
