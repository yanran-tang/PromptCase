The De Connick family citizens of South Africa applied for Convention refugee status in Canada after fleeing the country due to fears of persecution from Mavis' family the former domestic worker for the family who was killed by their Zulu male employee Ben. The Canadian authorities found their account of events credible but did not deem their situation to qualify as persecution under the Immigration Act leading to the family seeking judicial review. The court found that the decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division was not unreasonable and denied the family's application.
