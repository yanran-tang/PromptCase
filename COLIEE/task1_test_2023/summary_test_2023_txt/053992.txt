The applicant's request to re-open a decision regarding disability benefits was denied by a Review Tribunal based on the lack of new and material information. The applicant submitted three documents but the Tribunal found that they did not meet the requirements for new facts. The applicant appealed arguing that a report from Dr. Elisabeth Zoffmann was not speculative and could have affected the outcome. The court ruled in favor of the applicant finding that the report was material and that the Tribunal's decision was unreasonable. The case was returned to the Tribunal for reassessment.
