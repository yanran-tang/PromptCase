This case is a judicial review of the decision to refuse the applicant's application for permanent residence as a self-supporting Convention refugee seeking resettlement. The visa officer found that the applicant did not provide adequate proof of funds and that several documents were still outstanding. The applicant's arguments that the visa officer erred in law and breached fairness were rejected and the judicial review was dismissed.
