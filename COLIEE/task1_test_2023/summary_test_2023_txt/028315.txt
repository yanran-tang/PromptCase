A Visa Officer denied an application for permanent residence and a humanitarian and compassionate exemption by an applicant because her mother a Canadian citizen did not include her name in the application for permanent residence. The applicant argues that the Visa Officer did not adequately consider the best interests of the child but the judge found that the Officer had adequately addressed issues of hardship and public policy considerations and dismisses the application for judicial review. No question is certified.
