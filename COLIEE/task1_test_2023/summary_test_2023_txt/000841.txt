The maximum education points are 25 based on different levels of completed full-time studies and types of educational credentials. The case also includes the specific requirements for each level of education.This is a judicial review of the decision by a visa officer to reject a skilled worker application for permanent residency in Canada due to a failure to obtain 67 points. Evidence of education was evaluated and points were awarded with no error found in the officer's assessment. The court orders that the request for review be rejected and no general issues be certified. The evidence of education should be clear and not a toy to be manipulated for personal gain.Barar Hanif a political science specialist from Pakistan and his wife applied for permanent residency in Canada under the skilled workers class. However his application was denied as he only obtained 46 points out of the required 67. The question was whether the visa officer erred in determining the applicant's post-secondary credentials and failing to consider the education of the applicant's spouse. The standard of review in such a case is patent unreasonableness.
