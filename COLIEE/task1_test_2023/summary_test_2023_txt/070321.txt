Jasvinder Singh Sran a farmer from Punjab India was denied refuge in Canada as a Convention Refugee or as a person in need of protection after he claimed his cousinâ€™s detention and disappearance put him in danger of persecution by corrupt police. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) found that there was insufficient evidence linking his claim directly to the five grounds of persecution listed in the Convention refugee definition. The RPD concluded that India was able to protect him and that he had an obligation to seek this protection before looking elsewhere.
