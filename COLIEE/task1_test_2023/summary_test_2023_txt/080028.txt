The case concerns Imre Gorzsas a 34-year-old gay Hungarian citizen from the Roma community who applied for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) after his claim for refugee protection was dismissed. Mr Gorzsas was diagnosed with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in February 2008. The PRRA officer rejected his PRRA application and found that there were less than mere possibilities that he faced persecution if he were returned to Hungary. Gorzsas applied for judicial review of the decision. The judge allowed the judicial review application finding that the officer's analysis failed to consider adequately the cumulative risk the applicant faced.
