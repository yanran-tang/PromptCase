A man who had been living illegally in Canada since 1981 sought a court order to challenge the immigration department's decision to deny his application for permanent residency. The court confirmed that Parliament had established the De Facto Illegal Residents Program which provides a path for illegal immigrants to gain permanent residency if they economically and socially established themselves in Canada. However those who entered illegally through an organized plan or who were reportable under certain sections of the Immigration Act would be excluded from consideration under the guidelines.In 1987 an applicant for permanent residency in Canada Mr. Johal was denied due to his illegal status having entered the country as a visitor and worked under a false name and Social Insurance Number. The applicant filed a motion against the decision but the court's decision upheld the original denial citing evidence of misrepresentation. The court recognized the difficulties for officers to obtain proof of misrepresentation after several years but encouraged them to look at the overall picture to make a humane decision.
