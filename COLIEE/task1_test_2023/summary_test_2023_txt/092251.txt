This is a case about a woman Fariba Masoumi Bavili who applied for permanent residency based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds after fleeing Iran due to her Baha'i faith. Bavili's husband became abusive and controlling towards her after her family fled to Canada and they divorced in Sweden. Bavili and her children entered Canada on visitor visas but their refugee claims were denied. The Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Officer also refused their application for permanent residency. They then submitted a humanitarian and compassionate application which was also refused.The Applicants who received social assistance since 2006 and had minimal establishment in Canada were denied permission to apply for permanent residency from within Canada. The reasons for denial included finding insufficient evidence of serious hardship lack of significant difference in school systems between Sweden and Canada for the children and unclear and insufficient evidence of risk from the Applicant's ex-husband. The Applicants now seek judicial review of the decision.The Officer evaluated an application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds from a woman and her children who claimed to be at risk of harm from her ex-husband in Sweden. The Officer noted discrepancies and implausibilities in the evidence provided and found insufficient persuasive evidence that the applicant faced a personalized risk. Additionally the Officer found that the protection provided in Sweden significantly mitigated any potential risk. Therefore the application was denied.
