The male and female Ukrainian applicants claimed refugee status in Canada based on persecution related to their religious beliefs particularly the male applicant's Jewish faith. The Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) determined that the events they experienced were persecution rather than discrimination and found there was not clear and convincing proof that the Ukrainian state could not protect them. The court refused to certify the applicant's proposed question and dismissed the application.
