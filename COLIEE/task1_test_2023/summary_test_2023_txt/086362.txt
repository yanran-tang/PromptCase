The case involves two Russian citizens claiming refugee status in Canada who entered the country through the United States. The issue in question is whether their ten-day stay in the US is considered sojourning which would make them ineligible for a statutory stay of their removal order. The court ultimately decides that the applicants did sojourn in the US and do not qualify for the stay dismissing their motion.
