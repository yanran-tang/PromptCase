The case concerns a 17-year-old Iraqi boy who claimed refugee status in Canada after fleeing violent tribal revenge against his family. However the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected his claim for protection citing issues with his credibility and lack of evidence. The applicant challenged this ruling arguing that the Board erred in its credibility findings and failed to sufficiently analyze whether he faced an objective risk of persecution if returned to Iraq. The Court ultimately allowed the application and referred the case back to the Board for reconsideration.
