The case involves a motion to set security for the release of a vessel. The plaintiff sought solicitor and own-client costs reflecting their legal costs of $14037.00 (exclusive of disbursements) and the defendant argued that costs should reflect a lower award pursuant to Tariff B. The court found that while the defendant took extreme unreasonable and extravagant positions solicitor and client costs should be kept within reasonable bounds and awarded a lump sum of $9000.
