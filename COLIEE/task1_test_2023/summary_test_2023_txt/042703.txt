The case involves an application for judicial review against a decision of the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which found that the plaintiff who fled the Democratic Republic of Congo due to his connection to the former Mobutu regime was not a Convention refugee. The plaintiff argued his right to a full defense had been infringed and the Refugee Division erred in dismissing his fear based on his ethnic origin. However the court found that the standard of review was reasonable and upheld the Refugee Division's decision.
