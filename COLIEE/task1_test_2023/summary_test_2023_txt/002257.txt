In 1996 a ship called the Brussel was sold at auction for over $6 million in Halifax after the plaintiff obtained Court orders for default judgment against the defendants and for the appraisement and sale of the vessel. The plaintiff's bill of costs for arranging the appraisement advertisement and sale of the ship was filed in 2000 and the Trustees in Bankruptcy objected to some of the fees arguing that they related to services provided to other claimants. The Court ultimately allowed only the fees related to the plaintiff and reduced the amount claimed by 40%.
