This unedited case concerns a rejected claim for refugee protection and the limitation of evidence that can be presented to a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) officer. Paragraph 113(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act limits the evidence to only new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available at the time. The Federal Court of Appeal held that a negative refugee determination by the Refugee Protection Division must be respected unless there is new evidence that might have affected the outcome of the hearing.This case discusses the requirements for the consideration of new evidence in pre-removal risk assessments (PRRA) for refugee claimants. The PRRA officer must consider the evidence's credibility relevance newness and materiality. The evidence must be able to prove an event that occurred after the RPD hearing unknown to the claimant at the time or contradict a finding of fact by the RPD. The evidence must also be materially different from the facts found by the RPD. If the evidence does not meet these requirements it will not be considered.
