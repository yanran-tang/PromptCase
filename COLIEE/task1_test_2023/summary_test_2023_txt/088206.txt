This case involves an application for judicial review to set aside a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division. The claimant who is the son of the former President of Somalia was found to have committed crimes against humanity and was excluded from refugee status. The court found that the tribunal denied the claimant a fair hearing by not providing adequate disclosure and by relying on unsworn statements. The decision was set aside and referred back for a new hearing. No question was certified.
