The applicant's family members came to Canada in 1999 and made a refugee claim which was ultimately refused. Nabil the applicant's son left Canada and was arrested and sentenced to one year in prison for his involvement with the SLA when he returned to Lebanon. The applicant himself made a refugee claim in Canada in 2003 due to fears of persecution by Syrian intelligence or Hezbollah for his involvement with the SLA. The Board rejected his claim in 2005 citing the applicant's failure to make a claim earlier and stating that the SLA incidents were harassment rather than persecution.
