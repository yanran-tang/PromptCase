In this case the issue is whether information related to a third party but in the possession of a government institution is subject to disclosure under the Access to Information Act. Canada Post Corporation argues that they are not a government institution and therefore the act does not apply to them. The dispute revolves around the management and control of certain properties which are owned or leased by CPC but managed by the Minister of Public Works.The case involves an access to information request made by a Canadian Union of Postal Workers representative seeking access to records related to properties owned or leased by Canada Post Corporation (CPC) and managed by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC). The records are compiled by PWC in the course of performing property management and related services for CPC. The applicant argues that the records are under the control of CPC and not PWC and therefore not subject to disclosure under the Access to Information Act but the adjudicator rejects this argument and rules that the applicant as a Canadian citizen or permanent resident is entitled to invoke s. 4(1) of the Act to access the records in question.The Access to Information Act defines a government institution as any ministry or department in the Government of Canada listed in Schedule I meaning their records are subject to disclosure. As the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) is not listed under the Act its records are not subject to disclosure. However PWC as a department of the Government of Canada is listed in Schedule I making it a government institution. The Comprehensive Realty Management and Services Agreement establishes a principal and agent relationship between CPC and PWC with PWC responsible for keeping records of services provided to CPC. Books records and accounts relating to CPC services shall be the property of CPC and transferred upon termination of the agreement.
