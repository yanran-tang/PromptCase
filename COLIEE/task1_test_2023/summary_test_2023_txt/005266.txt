The case concerns the interpretation of s. 52 of the Immigration Act which states that a removal order shall not be executed where it would violate another order made by a judicial body in Canada or where the person's presence is required in criminal proceedings. The court rules that a probation order does not meet the test for deferring a deportation order and dismisses the application.
