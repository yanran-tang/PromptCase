Ms. Anna Chow sought judicial review of the decision made by the Adjudicator who dismissed her grievances submitted to the Public Service Staff Relations Act as an alternate process for redress was available to her under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The case is about Chow's employment with Statistics Canada and her inability to return to work due to disability.The Employer requested a health assessment from the Applicant to determine if she is ready to return to work and if there are any restrictions that must be respected. The Applicant's family physician confirmed that she has been fit for work since November 2000. The Employer threatened to terminate her employment if she failed to comply with the request for the medical evaluation.The Applicant's employment was terminated due to her lack of cooperation with efforts to address her absences from work. Prior to her termination she had filed numerous grievances but only a few were consolidated for adjudication. The former Board returned some grievances as outside its jurisdiction and the Employer challenged the jurisdiction of an adjudicator to hear the remaining grievances. The Applicant requested that the files be held in abeyance until her complaint before the Canadian Human Rights Commission was resolved.
