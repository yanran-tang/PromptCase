Mr. Chiasson nominated his father a Canadian Merchant Navy veteran for a bravery decoration but was told that the two-year rule prevented consideration of the nomination. After Mr. Chiasson challenged the rule the Canadian Decorations Advisory Committee discussed the issue and decided that the rule should not be included in the regulations but should be applied on a case-by-case basis. Mr. Chiasson was not informed of the decision until September due to an administrative oversight.The Canadian Decorations Advisory Committee has upheld a two-year limit on the submission of petitions for honours as it is a matter of Crown prerogative and therefore not justiciable. A legal challenge to the decision was made by a petitioner seeking a writ of mandamus but the court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action for mandamus which is only available on judicial review.
