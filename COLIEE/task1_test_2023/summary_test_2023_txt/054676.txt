Muhammad Kashifâ€™s wife may have been a victim of an honour killing by her family in Pakistan but the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board was not convinced of his refugee status stating that state protection was available to him. Kashif had not met his burden to refute the presumption of state protection and therefore his application was dismissed.
