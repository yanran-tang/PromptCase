Dr. Hyun Joo Park applied for permanent residence in Canada but her application was denied due to her spouse's conviction for drunk driving in South Korea rendering him criminally inadmissible to Canada. The visa officer compared the wording of the South Korean and Canadian laws to determine the equivalency of the offences. Based on the evidence submitted the officer was satisfied that the essential ingredients of the respective offences were established and the application was dismissed. The applicant's spouse may apply for rehabilitation in 2012.
