The applicant a commercial fisherman is seeking a writ of certiorari and a writ of mandamus against the Department of Fisheries and Oceans regarding their decision to impose a quota of 158.76 metric tonnes of shrimp on him. The applicant argues that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans does not have the discretion to attach such conditions to fishing licenses and is seeking to have the decision quashed and an order made compelling the Minister to allocate a quota of 227 metric tonnes of shrimp to him. The court found that the Minister had the discretion to impose quotas on shrimp fishermen and did so in a fair and equitable program.
