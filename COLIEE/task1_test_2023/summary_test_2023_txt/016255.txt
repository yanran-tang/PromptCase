The plaintiff sought an order for the return or destruction of documents copied during the discovery process and given to the defendant which were not presented in court nor became part of the public record. The defendant argued that they could not destroy or return the documents due to their statutory obligation under the National Archives of Canada Act. The court ruled that the documents were subject to the implied undertaking which was imposed by the court on a litigant who takes advantage of the discovery process and ordered the defendant to return the documents. The court also awarded costs to the plaintiff.
