The case involves a mother and daughter claiming Convention refugee status due to a fear of persecution in Sri Lanka. The CRDD determined them not to be Convention refugees but the court has set aside the decision due to errors in the findings of fact. The case is being referred back for rehearing and redetermination but the court has modified the order to allow the new panel to take into account the evidence previously heard. No questions have been certified.
