Glendon St. Patrick Stephenson a Jamaican citizen and permanent resident of Canada appealed a removal order due to a drug trafficking conviction. The Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) stayed the order for three years if certain conditions were met. The IAD later reconsidered the appeal finding Stephenson had breached some conditions but allowed him to remain due to the minor breaches and lack of evidence that traffic violations constituted a breach of the condition to keep the peace and be of good behavior.The case involved a permanent resident appealing against a removal order because of convictions under the Ontario Highway Traffic Act. The Immigration and Appeal Division (IAD) found that the convictions did not breach the condition of good behavior and that the breach if any was minor. The IAD cancelled the stay and allowed the appeal and the Minister raised two issues relating to the IAD's failure to consider all circumstances and the definition of sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations.Paragraph 70(1)(b) of the previous Immigration Act allowed permanent residents or those with valid returning resident permits to appeal a removal order based on the grounds that they should not be removed from Canada due to all circumstances of the case. The Supreme Court approved a broad approach to this paragraph and its factors remained relevant for the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) to consider during an appeal. However the Act is silent about what factors the IAD should consider when it reconsiders a stay of removal order. This is similar to the situation under the previous Act where section 74(3) did not specify the factors to be considered when the IAD amended or canceled a stay. Despite the silence the Federal Court of Appeal held that the IAD is required to consider all relevant factors when making such decisions.
