The plaintiff's claim was dismissed due to delay and the defendants sought an award of their costs. Though it was not usual to award costs when a claim is dismissed due to the court's initiative the defendants argued that they should not be denied costs based on their conduct. The court found in favour of the defendants and ordered the plaintiff to pay their costs.
