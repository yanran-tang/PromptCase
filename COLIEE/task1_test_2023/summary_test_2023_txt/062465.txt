The case involves an application for judicial review pursuant to section 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board concerning a citizen of Ukraine who alleged that he was a homosexual in a homophobic country and that his life was at risk. The Board determined that the applicant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. However the Federal Court found the Board's decision unreasonable due to the lack of a full assessment of the evidence and the failure to consider important evidence provided by the applicant. The decision was set aside and sent back to the Immigration Refugee Board to be heard by a different member.
