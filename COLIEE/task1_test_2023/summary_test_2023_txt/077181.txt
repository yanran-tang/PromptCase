The applicant filed a complaint against her employer the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) and a senior administrative officer for alleged harassment and discrimination based on disabilities. The complaint was dismissed after an investigation and the applicant filed an application for an order quashing the decision and directing a new appointment. The court dismissed the application ruling that the CHRC had jurisdiction over its own employees under the Canadian Human Rights Act and that there was no reasonable apprehension of bias. Additionally the court stated that the applicant cannot attempt to introduce new elements into her original complaint.
