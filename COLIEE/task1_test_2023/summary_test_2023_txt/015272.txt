The applicant Jamal Muhammed claimed refugee status in Canada citing fear of persecution by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) which had forced him to join their forces. The application for judicial review was dismissed as the panel found several implausible aspects of Muhammed's story including his claimed recruitment by the SPLA his walking out of the training camp unnoticed and his assumption that the soldiers who killed his parents were SPLA forces. The panel concluded that Muhammed was not a Convention refugee.
