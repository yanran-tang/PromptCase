The applicant an inmate at the Mission Institution in British Columbia with a serious visual handicap needs specialized equipment and accessories to watch television on his computer. The Correctional Service Canada did not dispute this but since 1997 regulations limit the right of inmates to have personal computers with certain peripheral equipment. The applicant's computer was confiscated in 2004 and this case concerns the interpretation and validity of Directive 090 and whether it violates the applicant's protected rights and equality under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.The court rejects objections raised by respondents in a case of an applicant seeking judicial review of decisions made by different officers of the Correctional Service related to his TV tuner card and storage unit. The respondents had objected to the applicant not identifying the decision he wished to submit and not exhausting internal remedies. The court finds these objections unfounded and allows for technical irregularities to be corrected. It decides to hear the application for judicial review due to the particular circumstances of the case.
