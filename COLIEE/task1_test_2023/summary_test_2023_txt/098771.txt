The Ontario Association of Architects applied for an order reversing the decision of the Registrar of Trade-marks to give public notice of the adoption and use by the Association of Architectural Technologists of Ontario of official marks. The issues were whether a third party may request review of a decision of the Registrar to give public notice of an official mark and whether the Respondent is a public authority for the purposes of sections 9 and 11 of the Trade-marks Act. The court decided that the Respondent was a public authority and that the Registrar did not err in finding the Respondent had adopted and used the marks.
