The plaintiff seeks to have the reassessment of the 1983 taxation year referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration on the basis that the gains realized from the disposition of managed investments constitute capital gains and not income from a business. The dispute arises from whether the plaintiff was carrying on a business or involved in an adventure in the nature of trade.The case involves a dispute over capital gains tax on investments managed by Trend with the plaintiff arguing that the gains should not be considered income from a business activity. An admission made during discovery by a Canada Revenue Agency auditor that he considered the gains to be from a business activity was then retracted at trial which raised questions about his credibility. The key issue is whether the admission should be considered formal or informal evidence and therefore its significance in the proceedings.The article explains the difference between formal and informal admissions in legal proceedings. Formal admissions are usually written statements made voluntarily while informal admissions are not made with the intent of being used as evidence. Admissions made during an examination for discovery are considered informal because they are obtained by lawful coercion. However the party who made an informal admission can still adduce evidence to explain or contradict it during trial.the courts do not view it with the same rigidity as a cross-examination. Admissions made during the examination can be contradicted or amplified by further evidence in court. The purpose of the discovery process is to enable the opposite party to know the case they will have to face and to extract admissions that may dispense with more formal proof.In legal proceedings statements made during examination for discovery are only a detailed description of the events preceding the trial and cannot be viewed as testimony or given the same weight as formal written admissions or affidavits. Such statements are informal and can be contradicted by further evidence as they do not carry the same level of sincerity as sworn or affirmed testimony. Any attempts to deceive the opposing party by contradicting such statements are injurious and insupportable.The court rejects the witness' testimony as not believable due to the witness testifying after an 18 year gap damaging both the defendant's case and the witness' credibility. Regarding the amendment of pleadings the court states that the principles to be applied in granting or refusing leave depend on the particular circumstances of the case and the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate the necessity of the amendment. The applicable test is outlined in previous jurisprudence with a focus on not causing injustice to the other party.
