Russell is appealing a decision made by a Citizenship Judge in 2012 to approve the citizenship application of a citizen of Bangladesh who came to Canada as a Permanent Resident in 2006. The appeal relates only to the citizenship application of the respondent and not to that of her children. The respondent provided incomplete information about her travel history including overlapping passports and admits to making an error in applying for her children's citizenship as they did not meet the residency requirement. The Citizenship Judge approved the application based on the available documents.The appeal concerns whether the Respondent satisfied the residency requirement for citizenship in Canada. The only issue on the appeal is whether the Citizenship Judge applied the residency requirement in a manner that made the decision unreasonable. The standard of review for this case is reasonableness and the analysis will be concerned with justification transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process as well as whether the decision falls within a range of possible outcomes.The Citizenship Act requires the Minister to grant citizenship to any person who meets specific requirements including being a permanent resident for at least three years and having adequate knowledge of Canada and its official languages. The Minister or the applicant may appeal a decision made by a citizenship judge within sixty days to the court. The court's decision is final and cannot be appealed. The court can only overturn a decision if it falls outside the range of reasonable outcomes based on the facts and law.
