Mr. Odilon Magalong was granted Canadian citizenship by a Citizenship Judge and Minister but before he could swear his oath he was arrested for sexual offences. Although he was never informed Citizenship and Immigration Canada had put his application on hold. Magalong now seeks relief from inadmissibility and removal proceedings but the court denies him a writ of mandamus.The applicant was not informed by the Canadian government that his citizenship had been suspended resulting in a delay in charges against him. After being convicted and sentenced the government prohibited him from taking the oath of citizenship leading to an application for a writ of mandamus to compel the government to perform its duty. The court must consider several criteria including whether there is a clear right to performance of the duty and no other adequate remedies are available. The applicant argues that the test for mandamus is satisfied.
