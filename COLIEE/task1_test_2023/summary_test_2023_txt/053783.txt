The court was reviewing a decision made by a Designated Immigration Officer to refuse Perez Enriquez's application for permanent residency in Canada. The Officer found that Enriquez had failed to provide conclusive evidence of working for Mysteriously Yours as a management consultant for at least one year as required by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations. In response Enriquez argued that the Officer's decision was unreasonable and breached procedural fairness. However the court found that the Officer had not breached her duties and the decision was reasonable. The court dismissed Enriquez's application for judicial review.
