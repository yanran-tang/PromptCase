Geophysical Service Incorporated (GSI) seeks an interlocutory injunction requiring Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board (CNSOPB) to remove materials related to seismic surveys conducted by GSI in the Nova Scotia Offshore Area claiming intellectual property rights in data from the surveys. The CNSOPB published a call for bids numbered NS13-1 in April 2013 which contained information submitted to it by various exploration and production firms and seismic operators including GSI. The board created 12 figures based on this information including potential traps and reservoirs within the offered parcels.GSI's seismic lines stating that the data is only for interpretation and not for publication and argues that GSI did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy or control over the use of the data by the Board. The Court found that there is a serious issue to be tried regarding the establishment of copyright in the data but noted that this issue is not determinative of whether an interlocutory injunction should be granted.
