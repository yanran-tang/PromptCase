The court dismissed the applicants' motion for a stay of execution of a departure notice ordering their removal from Canada for failing to establish that they would suffer irreparable harm if the process was not stayed at that stage. The court established that the public interest in carrying out statutory programs will only be outweighed by an individual's interest in exceptional cases. The court urged that the applicants should not be compelled to leave Canada before the completion of their respective school years. No costs were awarded.
