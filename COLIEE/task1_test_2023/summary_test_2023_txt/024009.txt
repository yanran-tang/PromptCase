Jin Dong Zheng a 14-year-old girl smuggled to Canada from China was apprehended by immigration officials in Windsor and applied for refugee status after being detained. However the Immigration and Refugee Board found that she was not a Convention refugee. Three issues were raised in the judicial review including the determination of whether the treatment Zheng would face from State authorities upon return to China amounts to persecution or not. One of the issues raised was whether the Convention refugee definition violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.The case of five Chinese nationals seeking refugee status in Canada based on their experience of being trafficked as minors was heard by the Canadian Refugee Determination Division (CRDD). The claimants argued that their experiences fell under the definition of persecution and that being trafficked as minors was a form of persecution. They also argued that denying them refugee protection would violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Minister argued that the CRDD should refrain from ruling on the Charter issue. The parties agreed to enter evidence from the lead case into the related cases.
