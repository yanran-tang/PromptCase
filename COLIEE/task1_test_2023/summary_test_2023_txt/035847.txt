The case involved a citizen of India with a history of misrepresentation and deceit who was detained by the Canadian government for using fraudulent documents. The Immigration and Refugee Board released the respondent despite his admissions that he would defy Canadian law resist removal and continue to stay in Canada. The Federal Court ruled that the board's decision was unreasonable and failed to consider critical evidence quashing the release decision. The case did not need to be referred back as the respondent's flight risk may arise if he is arrested again.
