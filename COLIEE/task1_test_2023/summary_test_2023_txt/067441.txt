Nana Joy Molefe and her son Kagiso Molefe citizens of Botswana challenge the rejection of their refugee claim by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. Ms Molefe alleges that her South African half-brothers are trying to intimidate her into surrendering her land. The Board rejected Ms Molefe's allegations and found that state protection was available to the claimants. The Court dismissed the application citing the availability of state protection and issues with credibility and corroborating evidence.
