Pfizer is seeking an injunction to prevent Apotex from producing and selling fluconazole tablets and capsules until the expiry of Pfizer's patent. Apotex served a Notice of Allegation on Pfizer stating that its process to manufacture fluconazole would not infringe the patent. Pfizer disputes this on the grounds that there has been no linkage established between Apotex's process and its new drug submission and that the process infringes the patent. A hearing is underway to determine the validity of Apotex's claims.In a legal case between Pfizer and Apotex Pfizer argued that Apotex had not provided a necessary process used in manufacturing the drug fluconazole which had not been disclosed in their New Drug Submission (NDS). Pfizer obtained an order for Dr. Sherman Apotex's expert witness to bring the necessary documents to court but Sherman revealed that the documents did not exist due to the NDS being a cross-reference submission.Pfizer sought a court order to require Apotex to produce documents related to their New Drug Submission process but the motion was withdrawn without prejudice. Pfizer later argued that evidence filed by Apotex should be struck from the record for not producing the documents but the court did not accept this argument due to the earlier withdrawal of the motion.The non-existence of documents related to the production of a drug cannot be considered a breach of a court order to produce them according to a ruling in a patent case brought by Pfizer against Apotex. Apotex had argued that production of the documents was not necessary and the court agreed dismissing Pfizer's claim that Apotex's Notice of Allegation was unjustified due to the non-disclosure of the documents. Pfizer was granted leave to argue other issues at a higher level should it become necessary.
