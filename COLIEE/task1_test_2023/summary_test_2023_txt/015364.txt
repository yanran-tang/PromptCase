MCQ Handling Inc. a garbage and refuse pick-up and disposal company hired Charles Moulton in 1999 as a long-distance truck haulage driver and terminated him in 2001. Moulton filed a complaint under Part III of the Canada Labour Code claiming he had been unjustly dismissed. Adjudicator Michael Lynk found that Moulton had been unjustly terminated and ordered his reinstatement and back wages. After a supplementary award on damages MCQ launched a judicial review application challenging the decision on the grounds that the Code did not apply to it as it was a provincial not a federal undertaking. The application was dismissed with costs.
