The defendant company filed a motion to revoke a certificate filed in the Registry of a Federal Court which related to an assessment of $175549.70 as goods and services tax pursuant to s. 316 of the Excise Tax Act. The Deputy Minister of Revenue of Quebec opposed the motion and argued that it was out of time. The defendant also challenged the constitutionality of s. 316 of the Excise Tax Act. The court held that the motion to revoke judgment was not receivable as a certificate is not a judgment but only a certificate of the Minister. The court also held that it does not have jurisdiction to determine the amount of the assessment and the expenses to which a taxpayer may claim to be entitled. Additionally the claim for damages and exemplary damages made in the context of the motion in revocation of judgment was without merit.
