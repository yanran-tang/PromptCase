Charlotte Rhéaume has filed an application for judicial review after the Canadian Human Rights Commission declined to deal with her complaint stating that the facts alleged did not constitute a discriminatory practice and that the acts that it was based on had occurred more than one year before the complaint was filed. Rhéaume challenged her position's elimination and her transfer to an equivalent position within the Canada Revenue Agency which she believed to be discriminatory. The court dismissed her application on the basis that her complaint was not supported by the evidence submitted.
