Tania Zulkoskey applied for Employment Insurance (EI) parental benefits but was denied as her spouse had already been awarded the maximum EI parental benefits. Zulkoskey argued that this practice was discriminatory under the Canadian Human Rights Act but the Canadian Human Rights Commission decided not to deal with her complaint stating it was vexatious. This case is an application for judicial review of this decision.The Applicant filed a human rights complaint alleging that the one-benefit-per-birth cap under the Employment Insurance Act was discriminatory on the basis of family status under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Commission decided not to deal with the complaint citing paragraph 41(1)(d) of the CHRA which directs that the Commission is not to deal with a complaint that is trivial frivolous vexatious or made in bad faith. The Commission relied on earlier proceedings including the Martin case which had settled the issue of parental benefits and multiple-child pregnancies or adoptions under the EI Act.
