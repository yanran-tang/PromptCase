Viatcheslav Gariev applied for permanent residence in Canada in 1998 which was approved subject to security criminal and medical checks. In 2002 a counsellor at the Canadian Embassy in Moscow concluded that Gariev was a member of the Russian Military Intelligence and therefore inadmissible under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Gariev brought an application for judicial review of the decision and the non-disclosure of information considered by the officer. The case dealt with both the Minister's application under section 87 of the Act and the merits of the judicial review application.Paragraph 78 outlines the determination process for a security certificate in which a judge will hear the matter and ensure confidentiality of information that could harm national security or safety. The judge will also provide the accused with a summary of relevant information an opportunity to be heard and may receive any evidence they deem appropriate. In regards to immigration foreign nationals must apply for necessary documents and may be denied if they or their sponsor do not meet the requirements. The minister may also request a judge to prohibit the disclosure of protected information in court.
