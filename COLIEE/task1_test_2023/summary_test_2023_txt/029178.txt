In this case the applicant Boisvert sought judicial review of the decision by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board which denied him a pension for cervical osteoarthritis stating that it was not directly connected to military service in peace time. Boisvert's initial claim included other conditions but they were also denied. The court granted Boisvert's request for judicial review and ordered the respondent to pay costs. No further summary was available.Mr. Boisvert a former member of the Canadian Armed Forces filed a pension claim for cervical osteoarthritis which he connected to head trauma from hitting his car and his duties as a supply technician. The Department found his condition was not connected to military service. The Board and review panel affirmed this decision due to insufficient evidence.Mr. Boisvert claimed his military service caused his neck problems but the Board denied his claim after reviewing new medical evidence. This evidence included letters from an osteopath and physiatrist a testimonial from a hockey coach and two letters from an orthopedist who concluded that Mr. Boisvert's military service was the primary factor in his condition. The appeal panel ultimately denied his claim.
