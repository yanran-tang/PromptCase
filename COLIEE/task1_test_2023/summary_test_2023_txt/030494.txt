Kamaldeep Kaur applied for permanent residency in Canada as a skilled worker specifically as a nursing tutor. Her application was refused by a Visa Officer due to insufficient information regarding her work experience and her subsequent request for reconsideration was similarly refused. Kaur applied for judicial review but the judge found that the Visa Officer had met their duty of procedural fairness and dismissed the application.
