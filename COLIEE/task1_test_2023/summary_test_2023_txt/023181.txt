The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division to revoke a stay of removal previously granted to the applicants. The principal applicant had failed to comply with conditions attached to his permanent residency status and there was no evidence that his businesses were making a substantial contribution to the Canadian economy. The case also raises the issue of whether the Board erred in failing to appoint a designated representative for the minor applicant. The Court concludes that the Board erred and that the failure to appoint a representative could have affected the outcome for the entire family. The decision is set aside and the matter is remitted to a different panel for redetermination.
