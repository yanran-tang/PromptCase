Mr. Mohammad Shabir Akram a citizen of Pakistan and a Shia Muslim sought Convention refugee status and claimed to be a person in need of protection in Canada due to his fear of persecution by the Sipah-e-Sehaba Pakistan (SSP) and other fundamentalist Sunni Muslim groups because of his religion and political opinion. The Immigration and Refugee Board found that Mr. Akram did not meet the criteria for either status and he sought judicial review of their decision. However the Federal Court dismissed his judicial review and found no reviewable error in the Board's decision.
