The Hussain family Pakistani citizens who claimed refugee status after arriving in Canada in 2000 sought a pre-removal risk assessment after their claim was dismissed in 2003. After this was refused they filed an application for permanent resident visas on compassionate and humanitarian grounds under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. This was also dismissed in 2005 leading to the Hussain family launching an application for judicial review which was ultimately dismissed by the Federal Court of Canada in 2006.
