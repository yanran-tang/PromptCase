Betty Sanderson claimed she was a victim of harassment and discrimination in her employment at the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs due to her being a woman and Native. Sanderson argued that the investigator's friendship with a principal witness limited the investigation's neutrality and the investigator did not properly address the racial aspects of Sanderson's complaint. The Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision was ultimately set aside due to a failure to meet investigation standards as evidence suggested Sanderson was a victim of sex and race-based discrimination.Ms. Sanderson filed a grievance against her employer claiming discrimination and harassment based on her sex and race. An investigation found that she had been treated in a sexually discriminatory manner but some of her other allegations were not established. Ms. Sanderson then applied for a permanent position but was told that another candidate had gotten the job. She resigned due to the stress of the situation and filed a human rights complaint against her employer for adverse treatment based on her national or ethnic origin race and sex.
