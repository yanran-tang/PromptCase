The Applicant Aparicio de Jesus Aleman Aguilar is seeking judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board in which the Board concluded that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection under sections 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Applicant fled El Salvador to Canada after being threatened by members of the Maras Salvatrucha gang because they believed he belonged to a rival gang.The board denied the applicant's claim for refugee protection stating that he failed to establish a nexus between his fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds. They also found that the generalized risk the applicant faced was not individualized and was faced by all young people in El Salvador. The risk to his life was therefore exempted under subsection 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA.This document discusses the standard of review for evaluating evidence in immigration cases and determining whether an applicant faces a generalized risk if they return to their home country. The court's role is to ensure that the Board's decision is reasonable and within the range of acceptable outcomes. An applicant argues that the Board ignored or misconstrued evidence in their case while the respondent focuses on the issue of nexus.
