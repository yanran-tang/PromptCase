The case involves a Sri Lankan male seeking refugee status who was denied by the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Officer. The applicant alleged that the Officer ignored relevant documentary evidence and selectively used portions of country reports which didn't assist him. However the court ruled that the Officer's conclusions were not patently unreasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
