This is a judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision declining to refer the Applicant's complaint to a tribunal citing that the complaint was based on acts that occurred more than a year before filing. The Applicant an employee of FedEx Canada was reassigned to a new position after his previous position was eliminated. He complained of vocal cord problems and was referred to the internal Disability Review Committee to find a new position suitable for his condition. The Applicant claims that he was forced to take a new position or lose his job alleging discrimination.The applicant was offered a day-shift position in December 2002 but chose to remain on the night-shift. A year later he requested a transfer to the day-shift but was denied and subsequently filed a discrimination complaint alleging disability. However investigations found no evidence of discrimination and his complaint was not dealt with due to exceeding the one year time limit. The delay was 23 1/2 months and the applicant admitted he did not have a disability at the time of the alleged discrimination.
