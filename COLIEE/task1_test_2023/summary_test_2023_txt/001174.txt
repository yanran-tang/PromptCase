This is the story of Azucena Margarita Ramos Ramirez and her family including her four children two of whom were born in Canada one in El Salvador and one in the United States. Ms. Ramirez faces being deported from Canada where she and her three children currently reside along with her non-Canadian daughter Jessie. Ms. Ramirez filed a humanitarian and compassionate application and a pre-removal risk assessment both of which were refused by the same officer. The H&C decision was granted leave to review and ultimately the officer's decision was deemed unreasonable.Ms. Ramirez and her daughters fled El Salvador due to poor living conditions harassment by gang members and threats to their safety. They entered Canada illegally and were found ineligible to make refugee claims leading to deportation orders. Ms. Ramirez applied for humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) consideration citing the risk of future harassment and separation from her family. The H&C application was denied by an officer leading to this review. Evidence presented included a counsellor's report indicating post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in Kelly and the potential for psychological hardship upon return to El Salvador.
