The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) that the applicant a Sikh from India is not a refugee under the Convention. The applicant claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution based on his political opinions and alleges that he was arrested beaten and tortured by the police. The court found that the Board's decision was patently unreasonable and granted the application for judicial review returning the matter for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.
