The Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CPR) is seeking damages of around $5 million after the barge Rivtow 901 collided with its bridge in British Columbia in 1999. The Sheena M Interests defendants in the damages action and seeking limitation of liability under the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims applied for a stay to pursue their action uninterrupted. The CPR also sought consolidation of the limitation and damages actions but the request was rejected due to different issues a conflicting burden of proof and different standards of conduct.The article discusses the limitation of liability regime in Canada and its evolution from the 1957 convention to the adoption of the 1976 convention and a protocol in 1992. The 1976 convention provides a virtually unbreakable right to limit liability making it difficult for claimants to seek compensation beyond the established limit. The authors explain that the convention was designed to strike a balance between compensating claimants and allowing shipowners to limit liability for public policy reasons.
