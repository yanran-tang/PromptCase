This case is about an application for judicial review of a visa officer's decision to refuse work permits for two Chinese nationals. The principal applicant received a job offer from a Chinese restaurant in Calgary but was refused a work permit because the officer was not satisfied that the applicant had sufficient ties to China to motivate return after the authorized stay in Canada. The applicants argued that the officer had ignored or failed to consider evidence showing ties to China and that he had breached the duty of fairness. The court allowed the application for judicial review and set aside the refusal directing that the work permit applications be re-determined by another visa officer who should consider all of the evidence before him.
