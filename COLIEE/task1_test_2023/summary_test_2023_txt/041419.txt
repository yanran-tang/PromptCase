A panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected Ngaripue Muvangua's claim for refugee protection claiming that she could avoid mistreatment by moving from Windhoek to Walvis Bay where authorities would protect her. However since she was never in Walvis Bay before the court found that the board made errors in its treatment of the issues of internal flight alternative (IFA) and state protection allowing for a new hearing before another panel.
