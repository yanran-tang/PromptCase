The case involves determining whether the plaintiff's operations of applying rubber covers to roll cores constitute manufacturing or processing goods for sale under the Income Tax Act during the taxation years of 1984 1985 and 1986. The plaintiff operates in British Columbia Ontario and Quebec and stores raw and synthetic rubber chemicals and other materials in its plant. The court visited the plant to inspect the operations including the mixing and blending of materials and the production of green material that is custom-made to specific orders and has no inventory.The process of repairing tears in roll covers involves cutting strips of rubber bathing them in an anti-stick agent and extruding them into a smooth plastic strip that is applied to the roll core of the customer. The covered roll is then vulcanized machined and wrapped in protective paper before being transported back to the customer's plant. The price of the covers varies from $50000 to $120000 per cover and the invoices show that 67% of the total cost relates to material and 33% to labor. The process takes around eleven hours on average with five hours spent up to the extrusion stage one hour for extrusion and five hours after extrusion.
