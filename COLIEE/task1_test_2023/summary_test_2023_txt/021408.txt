This unedited case involves a plaintiff seeking a declaration that the defendant failed to deal with his request for a review of his conviction properly. The defendant seeks to strike out the statement of claim on the basis that the Minister of Justice had acted as a federal board or tribunal for which a declaration can only be obtained through judicial review. The court allows the plaintiff 45 days to seek a time extension to commence judicial review proceedings and a conversion of the action into an application for judicial review.
