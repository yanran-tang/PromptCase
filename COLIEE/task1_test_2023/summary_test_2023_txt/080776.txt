Raphael Eller De Melo a Brazilian citizen applied for judicial review of a senior immigration officer's decision that he was not in need of protection under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The officer found that De Melo failed to access state protection in Brazil. De Melo argued that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms mandates an analysis balancing his interests against that of Canadians but the court found the officer's decision was reasonable and it was unnecessary to address De Melo's charter argument. De Melo had a criminal history and was excluded from refugee protection under Article 1(F)(b) of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.The Canadian government denied a refugee applicantâ€™s claim for asylum citing a lack of clear and convincing evidence that the applicant would face harm if they were returned to their home country of Brazil. The applicant argued that the government had not properly assessed all risks captured by section 7 of the Charter and that Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations should be amended to include a full assessment of all rights and interests protected by section 7 of the Charter.
