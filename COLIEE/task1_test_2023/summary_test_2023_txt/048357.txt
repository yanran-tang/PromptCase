Apotex has been granted an application to file three affidavits by the Federal Court. Hassle had sought an order prohibiting the Ministry of National Health and Welfare from issuing a Notice of Compliance to Apotex in respect of the medicine omeprazole. However Hassle has allowed only a limited time for the affidavits to be filed which may prove impractical for Apotex. There has been a previous delay in the proceedings caused by Apotex's oversight and they must pay $1000 in costs.
