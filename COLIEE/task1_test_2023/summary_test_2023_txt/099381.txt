The case involves a 25-year-old South African woman and her daughter who claim to be refugees in Canada on the basis of political opinions. The Canadian immigration board found inconsistencies and a lack of credibility in the woman's testimony resulting in her application being denied. The woman challenged the decision alleging bias and unfair questioning by the board. However the court found no evidence to support such claims and denied her application for judicial review.
