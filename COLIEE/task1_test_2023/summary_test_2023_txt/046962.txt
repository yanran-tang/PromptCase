The case involves a judicial review of the Chief of the Defence Staff's decision to approve the release of a Navy Petty Officer Second Class due to his failure to attain technical qualifications. The applicant had failed the Qualification 6 level course multiple times and had been recommended for release twice before his eventual release in July 1994. The applicant claimed that he did not have direct access to the decision-maker and was not given an opportunity to respond to the reason for his release. However the court dismissed the application for judicial review stating that there was no error by the Chief of the Defence Staff and no failure of natural justice.
