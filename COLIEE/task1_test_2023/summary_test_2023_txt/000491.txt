Leila Paul filed a complaint against her former employer CBC for discrimination on the grounds of sex and age in relation to job opportunities. The Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) commenced an investigation and scheduled interviews with witnesses which were canceled when Paul raised new allegations of sexual harassment. She later filed a separate complaint against an executive producer for coercion into a sexual relationship. The CBC was notified of the complaint by the CHRC in 1989.The CBC raised concerns about the Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision to investigate an amended complaint including a new allegation of sexual harassment arguing that it was time-barred and raised new grounds. The CHRC acknowledged that the new allegation was time-barred but decided to present it to the Commission for a formal determination. The Commission ruled that the complaint should be investigated which led to the CBC making an application for writs of prohibition and certiorari alleging procedural fairness breaches. The CBC's attack was focused on the actions of the CHRC officers involved in the complaint investigation which led to the loss of objectivity and procedural fairness breaches.ollowing her initial complaint the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) suggested to Ms. Paul that she add a claim of sexual discrimination to her complaint against the CBC. After adding the claim and providing further documentation Ms. Paul revealed to the investigator that she had been sexually harassed by a CBC executive producer. The investigator halted interviews with CBC employees scheduled for the next day in order to investigate this new claim.
