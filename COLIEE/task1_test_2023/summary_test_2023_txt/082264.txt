This is a case where the applicant who employs domestic help and maintains an employee source deduction account with Revenue Canada is contesting a requirement to pay issued by the Minister of National Revenue. The applicant alleges that she made reporting errors but the Minister's auditing activities constitute harassment and the monies collected should be repaid.licant had already brought her records to the office and the audit was unnecessary. The applicant filed Notices of Objection to the assessments for the 1988 and 1989 taxation years stating that no amounts were owing for unremitted source deductions. However Revenue Canada assessed the applicant for an additional $121.15 owing for the 1988 taxation year which had been remitted by the applicant but applied towards her 1991 taxation year. This led to the applicant's debt to the Crown being assessed at $1135.58 and a requirement to pay was delivered to her bank.
