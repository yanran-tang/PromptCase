Eun Mee Kim a female citizen of the Republic of Korea claimed to be a victim of spousal abuse and sought refugee protection. However she was found not to be a refugee or a person in need of protection by the Refugee Protection Division. The court dismissed her application for judicial review stating that she failed to establish that state protection was non-existent or inadequate. The RPD had considered the state structure for the protection of abused women and had taken account of the U.S. DOS reports.
