In this case a Nigerian woman claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution as a female victim of spousal abuse. She fled to Canada and applied for refugee status but the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) found her not credible and refused her claim. She then filed an application for judicial review challenging the IRB's decision. The IRB remarked that the applicant had not produced any additional documentary evidence after her first hearing and that she had not established that she left her country for the reasons she had given. The case involves issues of credibility and documentation.The IRB found the applicant's credibility to be lacking due to inconsistencies regarding her passport birth certificate and the circumstances of her escape. She was deemed not diligent in presenting additional evidence and her credibility was undermined by conflicting and obscure evidence. The IRB concluded that she was not credible in her testimony.
