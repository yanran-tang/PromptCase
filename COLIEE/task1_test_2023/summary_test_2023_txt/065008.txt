The case concerns an Ethiopian national who claimed refugee status in Canada due to his political beliefs and fear of persecution by the Ethiopian government. The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) denied his claim finding inconsistencies in his testimony and a lack of subjective fear of persecution. The applicant sought judicial review of the IRB's decision citing a failure to perform a proper analysis under section 97 of the IRPA. The court found the IRB's analysis of the section 96 claim to be valid but ordered a redetermination of the section 97 claim as the IRB failed to consider documentary evidence indicating a risk of persecution for members and sympathizers of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) a political opposition group to which the applicant belonged.
