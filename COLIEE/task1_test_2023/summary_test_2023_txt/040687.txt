The case involves an Indo-Guyanese citizen who claimed refugee status in Canada due to his perceived political affiliation with the mainly Indo-Guyanese People's Progressive Party. He feared persecution from the mainly Afro-Guyanese People's National Congress and claimed that the police would not protect him. However the Immigration and Refugee Board found that the state could provide protection and rejected his claim. The applicant sought judicial review of this decision but the court found that the Board's decision was not patently unreasonable and dismissed the application.
