This case involves a dual appeal and cross-appeal by both the plaintiff and defendant in relation to orders made by Prothonotary Hargrave regarding requests for information and documents during examinations for discovery. The main issue is an alleged infringement of a patent for a lottery ticket integrity number by the defendant who is accused of pasting winning faces on tickets and resubmitting them. The plaintiff's patented procedure involves an algorithmic relationship between accounting information and a number on the reverse of the ticket.The plaintiff Pollard Banknote Limited claims that 47 types of instant-win lottery tickets manufactured by the defendant Scientific Games Corporation infringe its patent process for printing algorithmicly related numbers. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's invention was obvious previously patented in Canada and unnecessary due to its own manufacturing process. The dispute is being heard in the Federal Court of Canada where appeals from the prothonotary's discretionary decisions are now subject to a more deferential approach although the judge still has the power to exercise their own discretion de novo in limited circumstances.
