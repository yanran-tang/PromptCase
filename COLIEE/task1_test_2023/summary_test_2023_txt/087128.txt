The case involves an application for permanent residence in Canada by a citizen of Peru under the Skilled Worker Class. The Visa Officer rejected the application on the basis that the applicant had failed to accumulate sufficient points. The applicant sought judicial review of the decision. The case includes a discussion of the applicant's background the immigration regulations and the criteria for evaluating economic establishment in Canada.The applicant challenges a decision to refuse their application for immigration to Canada arguing that the visa officer breached procedural fairness by not allowing them to provide evidence of settlement funds. The respondent argues that the refusal was based on the points available to the applicant and not settlement funds and that the visa officer was not required to consider settlement funds or give the applicant an opportunity to make submissions in that regard. The issue is whether the visa officer committed a reviewable error in the manner in which they dealt with the application.
