Daniel Brennan a federal penitentiary inmate was convicted of refusing to provide a random urine sample and seeks judicial review. Though there were concerns about the evidence in the case the conviction was upheld as there was evidence to suggest that the liquid provided was not urine. The collector's evidence about the temperature strip was accepted though his evidence about the colour of the sample was unconvincing. The standard of review was reasonableness and the application for judicial review was dismissed.
