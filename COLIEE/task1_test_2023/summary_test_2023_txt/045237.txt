This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board in which the applicant a citizen of Colombia was denied refugee status. The applicant claimed fear of persecution by a Colombian organized crime group but the Board was not satisfied with the believability of the applicant's story and found that there was no objective basis for the fear. The court upholds the Board's decision stating that the applicant has not provided evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection in Colombia or to show any objective risk of persecution.
