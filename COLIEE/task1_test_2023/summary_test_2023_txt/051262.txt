The case is about an application for judicial review of a decision of an Immigration Officer at the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi who refused the applicant's application for a temporary residence visa. The applicant had been communicating with the Business Immigration and Investment Branch to apply for permanent residence and was directed to obtain a visitor visa to attend an interview in Canada. Ultimately the officer refused the visa due to inconsistencies in the funds claimed by the applicant and his lack of previous travel or evidence of financial stability. The court found no breach of procedural fairness and dismissed the application.
