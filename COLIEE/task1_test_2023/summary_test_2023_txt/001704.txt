Navaratnam Nimaleswaran is a Tamil male from Jaffna Sri Lanka who claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution by the Sri Lankan authorities. Despite having been detained and beaten twice the Board found that the treatment did not amount to persecution. However the judge found that the Boardâ€™s analysis was deficient and the finding on both past treatment and future risk cannot stand. The matter was remitted to a differently constituted panel for redetermination.
