Jean Ã‰douard Conille a Haitian citizen who arrived in Canada in 1973 filed an application for citizenship in 1995 which has still not been processed. He has sought a writ of mandamus to direct the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to process his application. The respondent argues that the registrar cannot act until the inquiries into Conille's case have been completed. The court finds that the registrar has a duty to act once an applicant meets the requirements for citizenship and has requested that their application be processed. The lack of a time limit on completing the inquiries creates a defective statutory framework which requires review.
