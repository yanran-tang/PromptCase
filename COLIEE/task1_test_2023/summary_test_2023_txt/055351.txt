Canada Post Corporation has sought to have Mr. Varma declared a vexatious litigant in the Federal Court of Canada. The corporation filed an affidavit detailing Varma's litigations history which Varma responded to with a motion seeking an adjournment to conclude his oral submission. The hearing was adjourned to April 11th 2000.The court ordered a one-day hearing for an application regarding Mr. Varma being declared a vexatious litigant. However Mr. Varma did not attend the hearing so the court proceeded without him and relied on publicly available documents to clarify the record. Mr. Varma had filed multiple unsuccessful proceedings against various government organizations and corporations leading to the current application against him. Section 40(1) of the Act allows for declaring a person a vexatious litigant if they persistently institute vexatious proceedings.
