The case of Mohamed Bilsim Nageem a Sri Lankan citizen who claimed asylum in Canada has been dismissed in a Federal Court decision following a review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Board had found that Nageem was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Board had identified credible problems with the applicant's testimony of persecution by the Karuna para-military group the police and army as well as issues with identifying his ethnicity.
