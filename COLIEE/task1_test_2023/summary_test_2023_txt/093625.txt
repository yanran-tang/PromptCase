Chief Robin Paquette and the Saulteau Indian Band sought a motion for summary judgment for an order that Paquette was the chief of the band and all other reliefs associated with that position. Defendants who were also headmen or councillors of the band disputed this claiming that Paquette had been validly removed from his position. The judge dismissed the motion as there were factual issues in dispute and it was necessary to weigh a great deal of competing evidence with credibility findings likely which made summary judgment inappropriate.
