The case concerns an application for judicial review by a Sri Lankan man who claims to be a refugee due to being targeted by the Sri Lanka Armed Forces and the Pillaiyan paramilitary group. The panel found that although the applicant was credible there was only a mere possibility of persecution and that an internal flight alternative exists in Colombo. The court upheld the panel's decision finding that it took all evidence into account and made a reasonable decision based on the facts.
