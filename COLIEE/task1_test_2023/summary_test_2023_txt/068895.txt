Hungarian citizens Judit Sebok Molnar Miklos and their half-Roma daughter Judit Gloria Sebok wish to stay in Canada as refugees as they fear persecution from Judit Sebok's former common-law spouse E and his associates. In March 2012 the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada concluded that the applicants were not convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The applicants seek to overturn this decision and in September 2012 Federal Court Snider J. allowed the application for judicial review to be referred back to a different panel of the board.
