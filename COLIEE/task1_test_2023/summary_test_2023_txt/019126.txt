The case concerns two actions Apotex Ltd. and Novopharm Ltd. seeking to dissolve injunctions prohibiting the sale of their slow-release diclofenac sodium tablets due to similarities in appearance to that of Ciba-Geigy's Voltaren SR tablets. Ciba-Geigy alleged that the resemblance would cause confusion and constitute passing-off. Reasons issued by Justice Rothstein in 1994 found a serious issue to be addressed and interlocutory injunctions were granted. Modified orders were issued shortly after.In a legal case between pharmaceutical companies an interlocutory injunction was granted to the plaintiff to prevent the defendants from marketing similar-looking tablets in order to protect the goodwill of the plaintiff's product. The defendants later appealed to dissolve the injunction arguing that the plaintiff had not pursued their case with due diligence in the years since the injunction was granted causing them irreparable harm.
