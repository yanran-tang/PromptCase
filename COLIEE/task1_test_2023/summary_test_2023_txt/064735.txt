This is a judicial review application against a deportation order made by an adjudicator of the Immigration and Refugee Board in 1996. The applicant a citizen of the UK and Ireland joined the Irish National Liberation Army but refused to kill a hostage leading to his torture and sentencing to death. He later sought police protection and was convicted of false imprisonment. The applicant was ordered to appear before an adjudicator under s. 27(2)(a) and 19(1)(c.1)(i) of the Immigration Act and the adjudicator determined that he was inadmissible due to his conviction.The case involves an individual who was convicted of false imprisonment in Ireland and faced deportation from Canada. The adjudicator found that the offense was equivalent to Canada's offense of forcible confinement and rejected the argument that it was political in nature. The applicant argued that he was coerced into pleading guilty and lacked the requisite mens rea but the adjudicator did not find these arguments convincing. The applicant also raised Charter arguments but the adjudicator held that they were premature.
