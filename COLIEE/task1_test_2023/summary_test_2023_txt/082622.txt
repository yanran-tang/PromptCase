This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Appeals Officer of the Occupational Health and Safety Tribunal Canada which found that a danger existed for a corrections officer at Kent Institution in British Columbia. The officer had exercised a refusal to work after identifying safety issues in a new satellite living unit. The application seeks to have the decision dismissed arguing that the danger had been resolved for most of the issues identified and that the lack of CCTV feed to the MCCP was not a danger.The case involves a Correctional Officer who refused to work in a particular area of the Kent Institution due to safety concerns regarding the lack of CCTV monitoring and the potential for guns to fall through the security bars. A Health and Safety Officer investigated and found no danger which was appealed and led to a decision that lack of CCTV monitoring increased the risk of injury for workers and that the horizontal bars added a danger as they may impede warning shots. The Applicant filed a judicial review stating that the decision was unreasonable.
