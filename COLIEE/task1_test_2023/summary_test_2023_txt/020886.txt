The applicant a citizen of Kenya sought refugee protection after being attacked and hospitalised due to a land dispute with his cousin who burned down his family homes and threatened his life. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected his claim stating that it was a personal vendetta and he could eliminate the risk by not pursuing the dispute. The Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) officer refused his appeal citing insufficient evidence to link the deaths of his friends to the land dispute. The applicant seeks judicial review.The Officer found insufficient evidence to connect the incidents to the applicant's dispute and concluded that the Applicant had not exhausted all avenues of protection available in their country of nationality therefore not proving that state protection was not available. The Officer also found that there was no more than a mere possibility of persecution or risk to torture life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The Applicant raises four issues related to the Officer's decision questioning the evidence and legal tests used. The relevant statutory provisions are defined.The Canadian law defines a person in need of protection and a refugee as individuals who face reasonable grounds of persecution due to their race religion nationality political opinions or membership in a social group and are unable or unwilling to seek protection in their home country. The standard of review for reviewing an Officer's consideration and treatment of evidence is reasonableness. The Supreme Court of Canada has stated that the reasonableness standard should be applied for both reasonableness simpliciter and patent unreasonableness.
