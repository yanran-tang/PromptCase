The applicant filed an originating notice of motion seeking to quash the decision of a visa officer who refused his resident application. The respondent argues that the notice is out of time citing that a letter from the officer is a courtesy response rather than a decision. The court finds that the letter is indeed a decision and dismisses the respondent's application allowing the applicant to seek judicial review of both decisions. However the court notes that the applicant should have sought judicial review earlier to avoid procedural difficulty.
