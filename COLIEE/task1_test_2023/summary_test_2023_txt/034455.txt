The case involves Mr. Nadeem Akhter Ali a citizen of Pakistan who claimed refugee status in Canada. He alleged that he had been a member of a political group the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) and faced persecution in Pakistan due to his political affiliations. However the Immigration and Refugee Board after considering all of the evidence dismissed his claim as they found that he was not a Convention refugee and excluded under Article 1F(a) of the Convention.r. Ali was a member. The Minister argues that Mr. Ali was complicit in these crimes and therefore should be excluded from protection under Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention. The Federal Court has listed six factors to determine complicity and applying them to Mr. Ali's case supports the argument for exclusion. The burden of proof lies on the Minister who must demonstrate serious reason to consider Mr. Ali responsible for a crime against humanity.Ali who was an activist was associated with the violent and allegedly criminal organization known as MQM which has been accused of involvement in murder torture and various forms of violence. These allegations are based on extensive documentation and reports from reliable sources including Amnesty International and the UK Home Office.
