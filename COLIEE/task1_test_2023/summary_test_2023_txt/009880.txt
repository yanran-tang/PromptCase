The case involves the Pinter family who claimed refugee status in Canada due to their Roma ethnicity. The immigration officer denied their request for permanent residency citing a previous assessment that found they would not be at risk if returned to Hungary. However the court found that the officer should have considered risk factors in the family's application for humanitarian and compassionate consideration even if a negative pre-removal risk assessment had been made. The court granted the family's application for judicial review due to the officer's error in law.
