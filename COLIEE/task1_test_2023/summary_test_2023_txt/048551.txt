The case involves Mehrez Ben Abde Hamida a police officer from Tunisia who claimed refugee protection in Canada in 2000. He was excluded from the definition of a refugee and deemed inadmissible for violating human or international rights. He later applied for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds but his application was rejected. However a recent Supreme Court of Canada judgment which overturned previous case law on the inadmissibility of refugee claimants on the grounds of complicity in crimes against humanity led to the decision being set aside and referred back to another immigration officer.ision of the UNHCR HRC that found the applicant at risk of torture if he was removed to Tunisia. However the officer ultimately concluded that the applicant had not shown that he would face particularly harsh or unusual conditions if removed and that his connections to Canada were not significant enough to warrant overriding his inadmissibility. The officer thus dismissed the applicant's application for relief on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the removal of a foreign national from Canada did not violate standards of decency. The court noted that foreign nationals didn't have an unqualified right to remain in Canada and that the hardship the applicant might face upon returning to Tunisia had to be considered. The court also emphasized the government's policy of not allowing Canada to become a safe haven for individuals involved in war crimes or crimes against humanity. Ultimately the court concluded that the applicant's inadmissibility and particular circumstances would not cause unreasonable harm to him and he could establish himself in Tunisia.
