Mr. Ken Fleet sought relief from penalties and arrears interest that had been imposed on him after he over-contributed to his Registered Retirement Savings Plan based on erroneous advice he received from his employer. The Minister's delegate Donna Mochrie declined to exercise her discretion to grant relief and Mr. Fleet requested a reconsideration which was also denied. The court found that the decision was reasonable and within the range of acceptable outcomes given Mr. Fleet's failure to file necessary returns and pay penalties in a timely manner despite reliance on his advisors. The application for judicial review was dismissed with no order as to costs.
