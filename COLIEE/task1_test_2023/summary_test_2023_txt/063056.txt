The case concerns an Indian family's application for permanent residence in Canada which was denied because of the son's medical condition which was deemed likely to cause excessive demand on social services. The family argued that they had the ability and intent to mitigate this demand but the Visa Officer did not find their plan credible. The family applied for judicial review of this decision.This document discusses the issues raised in an application for judicial review regarding a Visa Officer's decision to deny medical inadmissibility to an applicant who required excessive social services. The document outlines the standard of review and analyzes whether the Medical Officer and Visa Officer met their respective obligations and if the applicants were given adequate procedural fairness. Insufficient evidence of the applicants' financial ability to offset excessive demand was also noted. There was no clear individualized plan provided and several non-medical conclusions were deemed unreasonable.A Federal Court judge in Canada has ruled on an application for judicial review of a decision by a medical officer determining the applicant's medical inadmissibility to Canada. The court ruled that the correct standard of review for the officer's decision was reasonableness not correctness and held that the officer's factual findings were reasonable. The court also considered the obligations of medical and visa officers in assessing excessive demand recognising that both medical and non-medical factors must be taken into account.
