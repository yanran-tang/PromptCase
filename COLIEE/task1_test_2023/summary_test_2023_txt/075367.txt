The Federal Court has dismissed the application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Deb family who had sought refugee protection in Canada on the basis that they were at risk of persecution or harm in their native Bangladesh had their claim dismissed by the Refugee Appeal Division which found their claims to be not credible and that they had a viable internal flight alternative available to them in Dhaka. The family sought to challenge this decision.
