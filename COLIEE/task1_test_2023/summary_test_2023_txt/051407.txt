This case involves a Sri Lankan woman who claimed persecution from various groups including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) the Sri Lankan government and Karuna and Pillaiyan paramilitary groups. However her refugee claim was dismissed in 2011 by the Immigration and Refugee Board due to lack of credible evidence and changes in circumstances. The applicant sought judicial review of this decision but the application was dismissed in court.The Board rejected the applicant's explanation for the omission in her Personal Information Form (PIF) and found that she had fabricated the ransom demand to strengthen her refugee claim. The Board also found the applicant's fear of persecution unfounded noting that the alleged incidents mostly arose from the husband's wealth and that the majority happened to her husband not her. The Board also rejected the applicant's documentary evidence as unreliable.The Federal Court in Canada considered the case of a Tamil woman seeking refugee status in Canada due to fears of persecution in Sri Lanka. The Board found that the applicant had omitted significant recent events from her Personal Information Form and that circumstances had changed in Sri Lanka since she left meaning there is no serious possibility of persecution if she returns. The court reviewed the case on the standard of reasonableness and found the Board's decision to be reasonable.
