The plaintiff owner of five design registrations under the Industrial Design Act sought an interlocutory injunction against the defendant manufacturer and distributor of a competing line of plastic tableware called Spotlights which the plaintiff claimed infringed their registered designs. The court found that while the plaintiff had a strong prima facie case they had not demonstrated irreparable harm that could not be compensated in damages so an injunction was not warranted. The defendant was ordered to keep accounting records of their importations sales and inventory of the allegedly infringing tableware.
