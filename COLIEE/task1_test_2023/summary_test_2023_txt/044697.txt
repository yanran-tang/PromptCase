The case involves a request for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division that the applicant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The court upheld the decision finding that there was no error in concluding that there were changes in conditions in Sri Lanka and that the applicant had an internal flight alternative in Colombo. The court also found that the applicant did not meet the burden of proof to show that he faced personal danger in Sri Lanka.
