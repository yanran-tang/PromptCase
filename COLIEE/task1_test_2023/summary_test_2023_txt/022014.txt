The case concerns a 30-year-old Somali citizen of the Isaaq tribe who claimed Convention refugee status in Canada due to fear of persecution on the grounds of political opinion and membership in a particular social group. The Immigration and Refugee Board found he was not a Convention refugee and the applicant sought review of that decision. The Federal Court held that the Board did not err in its conclusions concerning persecution by the Barre regime or the availability of government protection. However the Board erred in not considering the particular circumstances of the applicant and the reasonableness of returning to northern Somalia. The matter was referred back for rehearing and reconsideration.
