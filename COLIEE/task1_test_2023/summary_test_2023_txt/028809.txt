The decision of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to issue a fishing license for snow crab to the Acadian Groundfish Fisherman's Association (AGFA) for 2005 authorising it to catch 480 metric tons of the resource has been deemed unlawful by the Court. The AGFA a body corporate with no vessels did not meet the criteria for obtaining the license. Furthermore the Minister's decision to issue the license in exchange for $1.9mn to be used to finance additional Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) activities was deemed to be ultra vires.
