This case involves Lieutenant Colonel Armstrong a Primary Reserve Officer in the Canadian Forces Reserve Service who seeks a judicial review of a decision by the Director General Canadian Forces Grievance Authority wherein the Grievance Authority determined that his service should be classified as Class B rather than Class C. This classification negatively impacts his salary benefits and pension and he seeks to have it changed.In this legal case the plaintiff an employee of the Canadian military filed a grievance asserting that he should be classified under Class C service which would entitle him to more benefits and remuneration. The grievance was denied and the court ruled in favor of the defendant finding that the plaintiff's employment did not meet the criteria for Class C service. The case involved complex regulations and policies surrounding the employment of reservists in the Canadian Forces.The Grievance Authority rejected Armstrong's argument that his employment with the Canadian Forces (CF) was permanent rather than temporary stating that each successive period of employment was for 12 months or less. Armstrong argued that CANFORGEN 023/02 was contrary to QRO Chapter 9 but the Authority found his interpretation of QRO articles 9.07 and 9.08 incomplete. The Authority concluded that Armstrong's employment classification as Class B was consistent with applicable law and policy at the time.The National Defence Act of Canada states that reserve force members may be ordered to train for certain periods and can be called up for any lawful military duty. The Queen's Regulations and Orders provide more specific classifications of reserve service including Class 'A' Service for training or duty not prescribed under other articles Class 'B' Service for full-time service in certain positions or authorized duties and Class 'C' Service for full-time service with the Regular Force or on specified operations.
