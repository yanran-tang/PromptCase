The applicant sought to quash a visa officer's decision to refuse his application for permanent residence in Canada and requested a reconsideration of his application with a different visa office or officer. He had applied as an assisted relative and received a family business job offer from his brother-in-law in Ontario which was approved by the Canada Immigration Centre. The visa officer awarded him only 7 points for Special Vocational Preparation and 0 points for occupational demand in the paper screening of his application. The officer later interviewed the applicant and questioned him about his discussions with his brother-in-law regarding the job offer which the applicant initially misunderstood and later corrected himself.The case involves an applicant whose residency application to Canada was rejected due to not meeting the required points for assisted relatives. The applicant challenges the visa officer's decision on the grounds of failure to consider relevant matters taking into consideration irrelevant factors and denying procedural fairness. The applicant argues that the visa officer failed to consider relevant policies and regulations in making the decision however it is noted that immigration manual guidelines do not limit the discretion of visa officers.
