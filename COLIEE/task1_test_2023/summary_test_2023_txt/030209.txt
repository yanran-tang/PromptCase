The case concerns the applicant a Nepali woman who claimed she faced persecution and risk under s. 96 and s. 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act if she returned to Nepal due to threats from Maoists. However the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected her application finding that her story lacked credibility and that her alleged fear was not well-founded. The applicant applied for judicial review raising two issues but the court dismissed the application as it found that the Maoists had lost interest in her and her family and her fear was no longer well-founded.
