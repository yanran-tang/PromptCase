The Halifax Employers Association (HEA) sought judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Commission's decision to refer a complaint of discrimination to conciliation and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. The HEA argued there were errors of mixed fact and law and a breach of procedural fairness. However the court found no reviewable error in the Commission's decision. The case concerned a complaint by Elizabeth Tucker who alleged discrimination based on sex in the employment screening process for longshore workers in Halifax.HEA was investigated regarding the rate of failures on the ARCON test and the higher proportion of women than men who failed. They provided information on the test and a document titled Ergonomic Review for Lashers. The investigator recommended a conciliator and tribunal be appointed. HEA requested amendments to the report and an extension of time to submit. They ultimately provided a substantive response to the report and Ms. Tucker commented on the situation in a letter emphasizing her experience and good work record.The Higher Education Authority (HEA) was informed that a complaint made about longshoring hours by a woman would be referred to a tribunal within 90 days unless the parties reached a settlement through conciliation. HEA filed its Notice of Application on December 22 2006. HEA argued that the investigation was not neutral and it was denied the opportunity to provide proper submissions and material. HEA also argued that the overall decision was patently unreasonable. The Court agreed that a breach of procedural fairness occurred and if so it would intervene.
