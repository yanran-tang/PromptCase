This case focuses on a disputed election held by the Salt River First Nation in 2002 where duly elected councillors were allegedly terminated and replaced. The applicants seek a declaration that they are the duly elected councillors an order nullifying the election and an injunction against the replacement councillors. The election was not held by secret ballot and there was no notice given to members about the election. The Salt River First Nation entered into a settlement agreement with the Canadian government in 2001 regarding land entitlement and settlement funds exceeding $60 million are being held in a trust.The Council of a Band extended its term to see an agreement through to completion delaying elections until August 30 2002. Following the election the new Chief appointed his sister as interim administrator but she undertook actions without the Council's authorization leading to her termination. The Chief failed to respect this decision and was ultimately removed by the Council after locking them out of the Band office. A meeting was planned to discuss his removal but his sister arranged to recruit support for him and charter transportation for Band members to attend the meeting.
