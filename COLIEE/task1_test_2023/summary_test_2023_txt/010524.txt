Mohammad Rafique Channa a Pakistani national applied for permanent residence in Canada in the CCDO occupational category of Salesman-Motor Vehicles. However the visa officer at the Canadian Consulate General in Buffalo New York refused the application for permanent residence as the applicant failed to achieve the specific number of units of assessment required for an interview. Channa's judicial review application was dismissed and his counsel was ordered to personally pay CAD 100 for costs as he failed to respond to the respondent's counsel's calls and never advised them of his intention to argue the two new issues.
