The case involves a judicial review of a decision made by the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada which ordered the applicant's continued detention. The applicant who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident has been held on an immigration warrant since 2006 and has been deemed a flight risk. The court found that the member erred in not considering the length of detention against other factors and allowed the application. No question was certified by the court.
