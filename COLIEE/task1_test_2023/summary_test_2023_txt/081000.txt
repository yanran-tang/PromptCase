The appeal involves Chang Fu Hsu a Taiwanese citizen who was denied Canadian citizenship by the Citizenship Judge Barbara Scott. The issue is whether the Judge misinterpreted or misapplied the legal test to determine eligibility for citizenship. Hsu's wife and daughters are already Canadian citizens. The Judge relied on the physical time Hsu spent in Canada instead of making a comparative analysis of his connection to Canada and other countries which led to an error in law. The appeal was allowed and Hsu's application for Canadian citizenship was approved.
