Mexican truck driver applied for refugee status in Canada claiming he feared persecution from Mexican security forces. He had been asked to transport drugs and when he refused his family was threatened. He was also beaten and threatened at gunpoint by police officers. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board refused his application citing a lack of nexus to a Convention Ground and the availability of state protection and internal flight alternative.The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada accepted the applicant's explanation for the delay and noted their efforts to seek protection. The Board also found that adequate state protection was available to the applicant in Mexico as it is a democracy with a relatively free and impartial judiciary hierarchical security forces and laws to address corruption and bribery. Additionally the Board concluded that the agents of persecution were unlikely to pursue the applicant in the future and that there was a viable internal flight alternative. The issues on this application are whether the Board erred in its analysis of the applicant's expression of political opinion state protection internal flight alternative and risk of torture.The definition of a refugee in Canada is a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution due to their race religion nationality political opinions or membership in a particular social group. A person in need of protection is someone who if removed from Canada would face a risk of torture cruel and unusual treatment or death in their home country.
