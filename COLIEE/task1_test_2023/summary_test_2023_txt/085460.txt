Elaine Michelle Richards a citizen of St. Vincent and the Grenadines sought judicial review of the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board which found that she was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.

The Board had cited a decision regarding findings regarding the availability of state protection in the Board's national documentation package in St. Vincent and the Grenadines but failed to address contradictory evidence.
