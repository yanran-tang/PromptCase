Two Afghan brothers Mr. Wahidullah Salimi and Mr. Ahmadullah Salimi living in a refugee camp in Pakistan were denied permanent residence in Canada after failing to prove that they were still affected by the civil war armed conflict or a violation of human rights in their country of nationality. The Canadian immigration officer found that they could return to Afghanistan under a repatriation program supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Federal Court dismissed the brothers' application for judicial review.
