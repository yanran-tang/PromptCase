The case is an unedited judgment in which the Federal Court allows the application for judicial review and orders the matter be referred back to the Convention Refugee Determination Division for rehearing and reconsideration by a differently constituted tribunal. The court found that the panel’s decision was unreasonable as it did not explain the reasons for disbelieving the parents’ testimony and failed to consider important evidence produced by the applicant.
