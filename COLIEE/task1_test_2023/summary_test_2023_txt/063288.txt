The case involves Apotex's drug Apo-Lovastatin and whether it infringes on Merck's 380 Patent. Apotex is seeking damages for an 11-month delay in marketing approval due to a lack of a Notice of Compliance (NOC). Merck has counterclaimed that Apotex infringed on the patent and is not entitled to damages under the NOC Regulations. The court is examining whether Merck's defense based on infringement will stand against Apotex's statutory right to damages.Apotex claims damages from Merck for being kept off the market from April 1996 to March 1997 and Merck countersues for infringement of their patent on lovastatin. Apotex argues that Merck's defence is not reasonable and that the counterclaim is an abuse of process as it duplicates issues being contested in another proceeding. The central issue is whether Merck's patent has been infringed or not.The case involves whether patent infringement is relevant to a damages claim under Section 8 of the NOC Regulations. Apotex argues that the NOC Regulations are separate from determinations of infringement and validity and that Section 8 imposes absolute liability on the first person for any losses suffered by the second person without requiring proof of fault breach of duty or infringement. Jurisprudence cited supports the view that the sole object of an action for damages pursuant to Section 8 is to compensate the second person for delay in issuing an NOC due to the first person's institution of prohibition proceedings.
