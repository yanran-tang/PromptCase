This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board where the panel determined that the applicant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The applicant is a citizen of India and fears persecution by the Indian police who suspect that he is associated with Kashmir militants. The court ultimately dismisses the application for judicial review finding that the panel’s determination of the applicant’s lack of credibility was not patently unreasonable.
