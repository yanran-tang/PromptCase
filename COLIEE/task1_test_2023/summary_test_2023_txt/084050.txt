Stan Sandler was required to file a Foreign Income Verification Statement with the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CRA) in respect of his 2005 income which he filed late. The CRA imposed a penalty of $2500 and interest. Sandler asked the CRA to waive the penalty and interest. An Acting Director of the CRA turned him down. Sandler then made a request to order a reconsideration of his request but the court found no grounds for overturning the Acting Director's decision and dismissed the application for judicial review.
