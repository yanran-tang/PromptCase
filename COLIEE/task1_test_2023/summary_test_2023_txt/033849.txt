The case involves Brian Arsenault a former member of the Canadian Armed Forces who was diagnosed with a lower-back condition whilst on duty. He later underwent spinal surgery and was discharged from the CAF due to his physical inability to carry out his duties. Arsenault received a four-fifths pension entitlement but claims negligence on the part of the physicians treating him. The jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the relationship between the Pension Act and further proceedings against the Crown are key issues in the case. The court ultimately dismisses the motion to set aside the earlier orders.
