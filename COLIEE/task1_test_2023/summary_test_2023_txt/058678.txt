The defendants in a trade mark infringement case sought to postpone the discovery and trial of the issue of damages or profits payable to the plaintiff until their liability had been determined at trial. The court dismissed their motion finding that they had not provided sufficient evidence that bifurcating the issues would save time and expense. The court also clarified the test to be applied when considering such motions. The defendants appealed but the appeal was ultimately dismissed as the burden of proof had not been met.
