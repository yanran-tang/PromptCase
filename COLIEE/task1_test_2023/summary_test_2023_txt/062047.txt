The case concerns an application to stay the proceedings of an inquiry related to the Immigration Act. The applicant had previously filed for leave to commence judicial review proceedings and for an extension of time. The court dismissed the application for a stay of proceedings finding no evidence of irreparable harm and that the balance of convenience favored the respondent. The court also discussed the issue of whether leave was required for an application for a stay in immigration proceedings.
