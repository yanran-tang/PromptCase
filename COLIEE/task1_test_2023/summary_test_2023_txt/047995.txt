Dole Food Company Inc. and Dole Foods of Canada Ltd. sued Nabisco Ltd. over proprietary rights in the trademark FRUIT BOWLS. Dole seeks a declaration that it owns the trademark and an order that Nabisco's registration be struck out. Nabisco filed a counter-claim and sought an injunction against Dole for alleged trademark infringement which was dismissed. The hearing for the interlocutory injunction was scheduled for September 28 2000.The case involves an application for an interlocutory injunction by Nabisco to restrain Dole's use of the trademark FRUIT BOWLS. Both parties are arguing for the Woods exception which allows for a closer review of the case on its merits if the result of the interlocutory motion will effectively determine the action. Nabisco claims that without an injunction their exclusive right to use the trademark will be lost while Dole argues that the injunction would cause them significant hardship. The motions judge will have to determine whether there is a serious issue to be tried and whether the balance of convenience favours granting the injunction.
