This is a judicial review of a decision made by the Public Service Commission Appeal Board Chairperson regarding the appeals made by unsuccessful candidates for three Division Chief positions with Health Canada's Bureau of Veterinary Drugs. The appeal was against the use of Management In-Basket Exercise 810 as a screening tool which allegedly violated the merit principle. The exercise simulates aspects of a management position by requiring candidates to perform tasks to assess their managerial competencies.The Public Service Commission used an exercise called the Managerial In-Basket (MIB) test to select candidates for a competition. The pass mark was initially set at 19/25 but was later lowered to 14/25 as it was deemed to be fairer to visible minorities. The candidates' responses were assessed by trained scorers and only seven of them passed with five candidates deemed qualified. All the applicants failed to obtain the required pass mark and were removed from the competition. The applicants made a separate appeal arguing that the MIB exercise was without precedent and designed to provide an unfair advantage to those who had held the positions on an acting basis in the past.
