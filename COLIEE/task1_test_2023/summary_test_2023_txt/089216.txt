The case involves a Tamil male who claimed asylum in Canada due to forced labour detention interrogations and beatings he and his family endured in Sri Lanka. The Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) denied his claim but accepted his identity as a young Tamil male from Jaffna. The applicant's main argument was whether the Board should have considered the objective risks faced by him as a Tamil male from Jaffna independent of any issue of credibility. The court held that the Board erred by failing to analyze the risk to the Applicant and the matter was remitted for a new determination by a different panel of the Board.
