A citizen of Zimbabwe who had fled her country and sought asylum in Canada after involvement in opposition politics in her home country had her refugee claim denied by the Refugee Protection Division (the tribunal) in September 2007. However the Federal Court has allowed the applicant's judicial review application and the tribunal's decision has been quashed with the applicant's claim to be reconsidered by a differently constituted panel. The tribunal was found to have made errors related to the applicant's claims of past persecution by militias and government agents because of her involvement with the opposition party.
