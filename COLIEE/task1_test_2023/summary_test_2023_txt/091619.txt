Parmalat Canada Inc. sought to challenge the decision of Trademarks Opposition Board member Jean Carri√®re who dismissed Parmalat's application for leave to amend its statement of opposition to Sysco Corporation's application to register the trademark BLACK DIAMOND. Parmalat had filed its opposition statement in 2004 based on several grounds including confusion with Parmalat's family of BLACK DIAMOND trademarks registered for use in association with wares such as cheese and related products and promotional items. Parmalat sought leave to amend the statement of opposition in 2007 to include an additional ground of opposition based on the comments made in Veuve Clicquot.Parmalat opposes a trademark application arguing that it does not comply with section 30(i) of the Trade-marks Act as the applicant was aware of the opponent's trademark at the time of filing which could depreciate the value of the opponent's trademark contrary to section 22(1) of the Act. The Hearing Officer considers whether section 22 can be pleaded as a ground of opposition and distinguishes the case from a previous decision ultimately concluding that it can be considered as a ground for opposition.The hearing officer considered various statutory provisions outside the Trade-marks Act that could potentially contravene the registration of a trademark. The opponent argued that the applicant couldn't have been satisfied they were entitled to register the trademark. The hearing officer also discussed a prima facie case of contravention in instances where a ground of opposition was on the basis of statutory provisions outside of the Trade-marks Act. Finally the hearing officer adopted the reasoning that the depreciation of the value of goodwill is solely a matter for the courts to determine.
