The court is considering a motion to strike paragraph 8 from the defence statement which contains allegations regarding the plaintiff's motive and intent in bringing the action. The court noted that the allegation is irrelevant to the case and has no patent causal connection to the claim for solicitor and client costs. Therefore the court orders the paragraph to be struck out.
