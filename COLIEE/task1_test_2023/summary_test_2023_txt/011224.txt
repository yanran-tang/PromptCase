The case concerns Mr. Jose William Gonzalez Ospina who fled Colombia in 2007 and claimed refugee protection in Canada under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Refugee Protection Division rejected his claim and he sought to have the decision set aside on various grounds. However the Federal Court dismissed the application finding that the RPD's decision was reasonable and well within the range of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
