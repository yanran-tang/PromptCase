Mei Zhen Zhan a citizen of China and a permanent resident in Canada was denied Canadian citizenship after being charged with a number of offenses including drug possession and trafficking. Even though the charges were later stayed the Citizenship Judge was aware of them at the time of the decision and denied the application. Zhan appealed the decision arguing that it was made in error but the appeal was dismissed.Ms. Zhan's application for Canadian citizenship was denied in September 2009 due to her being presently charged with listed offences which violated section 22 of the Citizenship Act. This section prohibits a person from receiving citizenship while they are charged with or on trial for certain offences. The Citizenship Judge also noted that the stay of proceedings in Ms. Zhan's case was valid until May 11 2010.This excerpt deals with the standard of review for legal interpretation in the context of a criminal case. The court notes that deference is typically given to a tribunal's interpretation of its own statute or closely related statutes but a question of law that is central importance to the legal system will always attract a correctness standard. The court concludes that the issue raised in this case is not of central importance and therefore the standard of review is reasonableness.
