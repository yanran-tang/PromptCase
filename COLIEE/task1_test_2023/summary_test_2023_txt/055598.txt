The defendant applied to strike out the plaintiff's Statement of Claim on the grounds that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the relief sought as the plaintiff was seeking declaratory relief by way of an action instead of a motion for judicial review. The Court held that the plaintiff's action could not possibly succeed and struck out the Statement of Claim. However the plaintiff was not prevented from seeking judicial review of the decision by way of a s. 18.1 application.
