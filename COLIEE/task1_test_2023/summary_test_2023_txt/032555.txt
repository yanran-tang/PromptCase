This is a motion for an extension of time to file an application for judicial review regarding the Registrar of Trademarks' decision to accept the word Icewine as an official mark used by the Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA). The decision affects the market share of the applicants Magnotta who manufacture and sell icewine. They allege that the application by VQA to register the name Icewine was a ploy by their competitor Inniskilin to regain market share.The case of Magnotta Winery Corp v Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) revolves around the use of the term Icewine. Magnotta applied for a trademark on the term but was unsuccessful due to objections raised by the Trademarks examiner. The VQA then requested public notice of their adoption and use of the term as an official mark without informing Magnotta. Magnotta later objected arguing that Icewine is purely descriptive and not an official mark.
