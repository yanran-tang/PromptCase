The Federal Court rejected an application for judicial review of the Refugee Protection Division's decision that a family from Peru were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The Board concluded that the evidence did not support their claim for protection and the Court found that the Board's findings were reasonable and open to it to make. The Court also found that the Board did not err in its assessment of the medical evidence and the applicants had failed to show any reviewable error by the Board.
