An application for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board was made by a Hungarian citizen of Roma ethnicity who had been determined by the Board to be neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The applicant claimed that he had been verbally and physically assaulted due to his ethnicity in Hungary which had led to him and his wife being assaulted; subsequently they decided to leave Hungary and arrived in Canada to apply for refugee protection. The Board rejected the applicant's submission that discrimination against Roma in Hungary amounted to persecution and that state protection was unavailable. The applicant had omitted various incidents and details from his testimony which raised questions of credibility given his psychiatric history although the letter from his therapist which explained the reason for these omissions had not been considered by the Board. The decision was referred to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.
