The application for judicial review involves Bradley Tippett's denied transfer request under the International Transfer of Offenders Act. Tippett who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine made a request to be transferred to Canada to serve the remainder of his sentence. The Canadian Citizen Request Forms required Tippett to provide reasons in support of his request including personal and family history residence abroad current and previous criminal history and program factors. Tippett listed his wife as a person willing to provide him support after his transfer and mentioned that he was with the wrong people at the wrong time when arrested.The applicant Bradley Tippett requested the transfer of his foreign sentence from the US to Canada. However the Minister denied the request due to Tippett's lack of disclosure of important information and failure to show acceptance of responsibility for his criminal offense. The Minister emphasized that public safety is of utmost importance when considering requests for transfer under the International Transfer of Offenders Act.The Minister denied an application for a Canadian citizen serving a sentence in the US to be transferred back to Canada citing ties to organized crime and a likelihood to commit a criminal organization offense. The ITOA states the purpose of the Act is to contribute to rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders into the community and requires consent from the offender foreign entity and Canada for a transfer to occur. The Minister is responsible for administering the Act.As per the ITOA the transfer of a Canadian offender from a foreign entity requires consent from all three parties involved including the offender the foreign entity and Canada. The Minister considers various factors before granting or denying the request including the offender's potential threat to Canada's security their intention to abandon Canada social or family ties in Canada and the foreign entity's threat to the offender's security or human rights. A recent hearing raised concerns that the Minister's decision lacked transparency and was unreasonable in denying a transfer request.
