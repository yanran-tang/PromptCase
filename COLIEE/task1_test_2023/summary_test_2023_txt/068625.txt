The case involves an appeal by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration against a decision that Mr. Yun Ho Chang met the requirements for Canadian citizenship. The decision was made by a Citizenship Judge who found that Chang had accumulated enough residency in Canada despite spending a significant portion of four years away due to business interests in Taiwan. The judge did not consider when Chang established residency in Canada which led to the appeal being allowed but no order for Chang's citizenship application to be refused. The matter has been referred to the Citizenship Court for reconsideration if the applicant seeks it.
