The plaintiff is challenging a decision by the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board that he is not a Convention refugee. He fears persecution if he has to return to Djibouti because of his political opinions and membership in the social group of journalists. The Refugee Division found the evidence submitted by the plaintiff was credible but concluded that he would not be persecuted if he returned to his country. The decision was quashed due to an error made by the Refugee Division in using the wrong test of persecution and the case will be referred back for re-hearing.
