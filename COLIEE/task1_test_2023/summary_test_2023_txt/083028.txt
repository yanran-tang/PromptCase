This article discusses a legal dispute between commercial lessees in Riding Mountain National Park and the Crown over a rent increase imposed in 1990. The dispute centers around the accuracy of the Crown's evaluation of the land value which was based on a report by an experienced real estate appraiser. The article examines a range of factors to determine whether the rent increase was fair and equitable but ultimately the outcome is determined by the accuracy of the appraisal.The article discusses a court case involving seven defendants who contested the government's rent increases on land leased by them in Riding Mountain National Park. The court heard evidence from appraisers on both sides with the government's appraiser faring better in cross-examination. The leases held by the defendants were perpetually renewable and contained decennial rent review provisions and the court ultimately ruled in favor of the government.The Supreme Court of Canada has clarified that the 'full annual value of the tenement' in a rent review clause refers to the income produced by the fee simple as if the land had not been leased. This ruling means that buildings on the land will be left out of the equation when valuing the rental rate.The litigation concerns leases in Wasagaming a visitor centre in Riding Mountain National Park which only permits occupancy between April and October. One lease allows 12 months occupancy. The defendants argue that the Crown did not give sufficient weight to the lease limitation when setting rents and complain about differential treatment of commercial and residential leases. The Crown's right to dispose of land is subject to the National Parks Act which authorizes the granting of leases and licences for various purposes. The applicable regulations are the National Parks Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations SOR/81-627.
