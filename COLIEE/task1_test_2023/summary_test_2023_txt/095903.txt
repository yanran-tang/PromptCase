The applicant sought refugee protection in Canada fearing persecution from the Sri Lankan army the LTTE and the EPDP. The Refugee Protection Division denied the claim based on credibility issues stating that if the army or EPDP wanted to harm the applicant they had ample opportunity to do so. The applicant applied for judicial review of the decision seeking redetermination.The Federal Court rejected an appeal by a Tamil asylum seeker in Canada who claimed he had a well-founded fear of persecution in Sri Lanka due to his race as a Tamil. The court stated there was no serious possibility of persecution as he was not identified as a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and his fear was not well-founded as it was not linked to a Convention ground. The court found that life had improved for the Tamil population in Sri Lanka and the UNHCR no longer had a presumptive eligibility for refugee protection for Northern Tamils.
