The applicants challenge the jurisdiction of the respondents to sign a treaty and a motion is made by the respondents to file a supplemental affidavit. The judge allows the filing of a new affidavit but imposes conditions to protect the applicants including cross-examination of the deponent and reasonable follow-up material. The judge also awards costs to the applicants due to the lateness of the motion.
