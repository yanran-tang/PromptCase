The plaintiff Sterritt has appealed against decisions made by the prothonotary including the striking out of his amended statement of claim which includes claims of ownership of all of Canada and being the true and rightful heir of God's crown. Sterritt purports to sue on behalf of all Indians but has no authority to do so. The court has dismissed his appeals and affirmed the prothonotary's orders.
