The court dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision by a Citizenship and Immigration Officer that denied a waiver to two adult citizens of Brazil who had entered Canada on visitor visas and stayed after the visas expired. The couple who had two children born in Canada had applied for an exemption from applying for permanent residence outside of Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. However the court found that the applicants did not meet the requirements for this exemption.Two individuals applied for permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds citing ties to Canada through employment history self-sufficiency civil record integration and their children's best interests. The officer denied the application leading to a legal challenge with allegations of inadequate reasons incorrect application of the test ignoring evidence failing to consider the children's best interests and an unreasonable and biased decision. The respondent argued that the applicants had entered Canada as visitors but stayed and waited to apply for permanent residency until years later. Section 25 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act allows for exemptions to permanent residency requirements if H & C considerations including the best interests of affected children justify an exemption.
