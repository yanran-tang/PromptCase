This case involves an Ecuadorian woman seeking asylum in Canada due to a history of domestic violence from her former husband. She claims to be a Convention refugee based on her membership in a particular social group but the Board ruled otherwise. The case raises questions of whether women in this situation count as a specific social group and whether the Board evaluated the woman's well-founded fear of persecution.A female asylum seeker from Ecuador claimed she was a victim of domestic violence but was denied refugee status by the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board. The board stated that the woman's fear of persecution did not fit the definition of a Convention refugee claiming that she did not belong to a particular social group. However the decision has been criticised with some arguing that women facing domestic violence are part of a particular social group and should be recognised as such in international refugee law.
