Estardai Beharry and her two children applied for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in Canada citing the best interests of the children and the hardship they would face if they were forced to return to Guyana. However their application was rejected by a PRRA Officer. The Federal Court later determined that the Officer's decision was unreasonable and remitted the matter to a different Officer for re-determination. The Officer had failed to properly assess the children's best interests and consider the impact of the traumatic events they had experienced.
