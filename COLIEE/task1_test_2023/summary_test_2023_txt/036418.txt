This case involves Plasticair requesting directions to be given to the assessment officer regarding the assessment of costs in a patent infringement case against M.K. Plastics Corporation. Plasticair argues that it is entitled to costs at the upper end of Column IV due to the complexity and importance of the case. Additionally they argue that they are entitled to double costs because they had served an Offer of Settlement which had not been accepted by M.K. Plastics.e are three main issues involved in this case: infringement invalidity and unfair trade practice. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's conduct was improper and significantly increased the amount of work required. The defendant's counterclaim was deemed without legal basis and their expert was deemed useless. The plaintiff also argues that the defendant's disbursements are exaggerated and that costs should represent a compromise between compensating the successful party and not unduly burdening the unsuccessful party. The highest end of Column IV of the Tariff of Fees may be appropriate due to the higher than usual volume of work and important and complex legal issues.
