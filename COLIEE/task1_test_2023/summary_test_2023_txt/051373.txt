This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board of Canada (VRAB). The applicant employed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) suffered injuries to both shoulders but was only granted a pension for his right shoulder. The decision regarding his left shoulder was denied due to a lack of evidence connecting it to service-related factors. The applicant seeks a writ of certiorari to quash the decision and order a third Reconsideration Panel to consider the appeal.The case involves a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer who suffered injuries in 1978 1980 and 2004. The case was brought to a Second Reconsideration Panel following judicial review and a Consent Order that quashed the previous panel’s decision. The Second Reconsideration Panel found that the 1978 incident only injured the officer's right shoulder and the 1980 fall was not related to RCMP duties while rejecting the physician’s evidence of recurrence and worsening of the left shoulder injury.The Veterans Review and Appeal Board act states that the provisions of the act and any other act of Parliament should be interpreted liberally to fulfill the obligation of the people and government of Canada to veterans and their dependents. The board may obtain medical advice and require medical examinations but must give notice and opportunity for argument before accepting such evidence. The board should draw reasonable inferences in favor of the veteran accept uncontradicted and credible evidence and resolve any doubt in favor of the veteran. In this case the panel found no evidence of a permanent worsening of the veteran's shoulder condition before the injury. The issues include the appropriate standard of review the binding nature of the consent order and the panel's decisions regarding errors in the order.
