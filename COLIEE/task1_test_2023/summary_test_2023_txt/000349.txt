Mr. Wang Ying Guan a citizen of the People's Republic of China applied for permanent residence in Canada claiming that his daughter Wang Huan Huan was his biological child. When the visa office requested DNA testing he admitted that he and his wife had adopted Wang Huan Huan. After being pressed for proof of adoption he admitted that Wang Huan Huan had never been legally adopted. As a result his application was rejected for misrepresentation. He applied for judicial review but the court found that the Officer did not breach his right to procedural fairness and did not err in finding him inadmissible for misrepresentation.
