A 72-year-old Canadian Navy veteran has applied for pension entitlements due to his ongoing bowel condition after serving in the Second World War. Although his medical certificate stated he was fit upon discharge in 1946 he has suffered from diarrhea cramps and loose stools since contracting dysentery in Italy in 1944. His application for pension benefits in 1959 was denied and a reconsideration of his claim in 1983 was unsuccessful. An appeal to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board in 1996 was also denied and the veteran has now applied for judicial review of this decision.vated form of colitis was caused by the applicant's military service. Despite the new evidence from two doctors suggesting a possible causal connection between the applicant's service and his longstanding ulcerative colitis the Appeal Board decided that the evidence was not strong enough to award the applicant pension entitlement for his condition.
