On June 11 1996 John Hargrave issued an order for plaintiff James L. Ferguson to post security for costs in the amount of $50000. Ferguson did not appear for the hearing and now seeks to set aside the order claiming he is a seaman who is impecunious and that the defendants delayed their application. Ferguson also seeks to submit fresh evidence.The plaintiff seeks to appeal the prothonotary's decision and introduces fresh evidence in the form of an affidavit that he claims was previously available but not submitted. The judge allows the evidence to be produced and acknowledges that the appeal is a hearing de novo. The judge ultimately determines that the plaintiff does not qualify as a seaman under Canada's Shipping Act and therefore rule 1014 does not apply.
