Mr. Rodolfo Guerrero Pacificador seeks a judicial review of a decision made by the Immigration and Refugee Board Refugee Protection Division stating that he is not a Convention refugee. He left the Philippines in 1986 and claimed refugee status in Canada on the grounds of political affiliation and membership in a particular social group namely his family's known political affiliations. He was politically active in the Antique province of the Philippines and is a member of a prominent political family. The Applicant is accused of murder and fears persecution torture and mistreatment if he is returned to the Philippines.The case involves a person who was alleged to have committed acts of foreign criminality and was found inadmissible. After an application for judicial review a re-hearing was ordered. The Board found that the person was not excluded from refugee protection and that the prosecution's case in the Philippines was tainted with corruption and interference. The Minister had not provided reasonable grounds to believe that the person had committed a serious non-political crime.The Canadian Federal Court rejected an application for Convention refugee protection by a man who was accused of non-political crimes in the Philippines due to his father's wealth and influence. The Immigration and Refugee Board determined that the man was not at risk of persecution mistreatment or arbitrary detention due to his family's status. The applicant argued that the Board violated natural justice by refusing to suspend its deliberations until the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision on his extradition was announced.
