The Federal Court has dismissed an appeal in the case of a dispute over proceeds of a ship sale between former shareholders and directors of a creditor which had been awarded funds following an in rem action on the vessel. The court ruled it did not have jurisdiction in the dispute between the parties who claimed entitlement to the funds awarded to Kent Trade and Finance. The case turned on questions of whether the dispute qualifies as a matter of Canadian maritime law and whether the court had jurisdiction over enforcement of its own judgments.
