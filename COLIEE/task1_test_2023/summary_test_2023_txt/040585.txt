This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division to reject an individual's claim to be a Convention refugee. The rejection was based on concerns about the individual's lack of credibility among other things. The applicant argues that he was denied natural justice because he appeared before the panel without his lawyer but the court finds that the right to counsel is not absolute and that the applicant was given a full hearing and did not establish any prejudice. Ultimately the court does not find any errors or defects in the Refugee Division's decision and does not intervene.
