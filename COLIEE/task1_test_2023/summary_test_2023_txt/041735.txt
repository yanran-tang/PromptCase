The Minister of Human Resources Development seeks a judicial review of a decision by a member of the Pension Appeals Board granting Ms. Hogervorst an extension of time and leave to appeal a decision of the Review Tribunal which had elapsed seven years prior. The Minister argues that the Board erred by not inviting submissions from the Minister and not applying the correct legal test. The decision was made ex parte and without reasons provided.ion was filed in 2004 and the designated member of the Appeals Board granted an extension of time and leave without providing reasons. The Court finds that the designated member did not err in his decision-making process and that the standard of review for this issue is correctness. There was no statutory obligation for the designated member to invite the Minister to provide submissions before granting an extension of time and leave and there was no requirement for him to provide written reasons for his decision.
