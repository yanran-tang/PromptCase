In 1995 AMAV's assets were sold including its copyrights.part of the agreement the Buyers (ERO NY Acquisition and ERO Canada Acquisition) purchased all assets of Amav Industries Ltd. including intellectual property customer lists and the Hickmore Property. The Stockholders Avi and Amos Sochaczevski owned the Hickmore Property through Amav Realty Ltd. The Buyers eventually changed their name to AMAV Industries Ltd. and the Stockholders remained with the company for two years after the acquisition.Hedstrom purchased shares of AMAV ERO but there is no formal evidence of this. They did not acquire AMAV Industries Ltd's intellectual property which remained with the company. In 2000 AMAV Industries liquidated and their assets were purchased by various parties including plaintiff Diamant who gained ownership of AMAV's intellectual property in the arts and crafts line of products. However one set of over 900 CD-Roms containing artistic work is still missing.
