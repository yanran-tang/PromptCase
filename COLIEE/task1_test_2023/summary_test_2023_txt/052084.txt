The court is considering a motion for an extension of time to serve an application for leave and for judicial review. The motion is brought pursuant to a section of the Immigration Act and can only be granted for special reasons. However the use of a solicitor's affidavit in support of the motion is considered bad practice due to potential solicitor-and-client privilege issues. The court notes that to grant an extension there must be a good case on the merits but the applicant's case is not clear from the submitted documents. The motion for an extension of time is ultimately dismissed.
