The case involves an application for judicial review by Leonette Plancher and her minor daughter who are seeking asylum in Canada from Haiti. The Board rejected their claim for asylum stating that they were not credible as to the existence of subjective fear and did not face personalized risk. Furthermore the Board did not err in failing to appoint a designated representative or failing to perform a distinct analysis under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The application for judicial review was dismissed.
