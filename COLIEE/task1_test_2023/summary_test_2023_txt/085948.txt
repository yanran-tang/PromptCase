This is a case where a visa officer refused to grant a visa to an applicant and his family because the admission of the applicant's son who is moderately retarded would cause excessive demands on health or social services. The applicant is a man of substance and he provided the visa officer with medical and psychological information about his son. Although the applicant and his wife are willing to pay for all services required by their son the respondent points out that their undertaking is unenforceable.This is a legal case involving a couple who applied for their son Tat Chi to immigrate to Canada from Hong Kong but were denied due to his intellectual disability epilepsy and asthma. A Medical Notification was issued stating that Tat Chi's condition would place excessive demands upon social services and his application was refused under section 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Immigration Act. The family requested extensions to provide further medical information and eventually after being allowed into Canada for assessment Tat Chi's demands were still deemed excessive and the application was ultimately denied.
