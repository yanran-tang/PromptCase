Mr. Phillips appealed a 1992 income tax reassessment that disallowed farm loss deductions for the years 1982 to 1985. He argued that the decision was wrong and the case proceeded before Judge R.D. Bell at the Tax Court. In the appeal Mr. Phillips was unrepresented by counsel but argued his case effectively focusing on whether Judge Bell erred in ruling against him. The facts found by Judge Bell showed a reasonable expectation of profit from the farming operation.The appellant decided to enter the sheep industry in the late 1960s after researching various agricultural sectors. He attended the first ram sale in Maple Ontario and joined the Wellington County Sheep Club. In 1977 he purchased 106 acres of land consisting of a barn hog barn drive shed and house. He pursued his goal of out-of-season breeding and purchased 150 bred ewes in 1979 financing the purchase by selling two houses and giving a mortgage for $30000. He planned to retire at 55 to focus on farming.
