An application has been made to declare the decision by Susan Zerr Supervisor of the Central Removals Unit of Canada Employment and Immigration Commission to remove the applicant from Canada to Mexico to be unlawful or invalid. The main argument is that the Supervisor acted contrary to s. 50(1) of the Immigration Act by removing the applicant while they were scheduled to appear in court. The respondent agrees that the removal was unlawful but argues against issuing a declaration under para. 18.1(3)(b) of the Federal Court Act. The court declares the removal to be unlawful.
