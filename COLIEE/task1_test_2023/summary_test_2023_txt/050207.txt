The case involves Mr. Ahmad Al Badawi Smoudi a Syrian citizen who became a citizen of Paraguay in 1986. He made a claim for refugee protection in Canada in 1995 which was dismissed by the Immigration and Refugee Board. However the Federal Court ordered a new hearing stating that the Board failed to consider the treatment Mr. Smoudi might receive for evading military service in Syria as the evidence showed he could face cruel and unusual punishment.
