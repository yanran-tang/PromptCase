Antonio Leon Davila arrived in Canada seeking refugee status from Mexico in April 2005 but was denied by the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board). The Board concluded that Mr. Davila was not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Mr. Davila challenged this decision in a judicial review arguing that the Board misapplied the test for state protection and ignored material evidence in determining whether he sought help from the state. The court granted the application for judicial review and remitted the matter to a differently constituted Board for redetermination.
