Tetyana Barnash a Canadian resident sponsored an application for permanent resident visas for her parents which was rejected due to their diagnoses of heart disease. Barnash appealed the decision arguing that her parents' condition had been stable for the last few years and that they would not place an undue burden on Canada's healthcare system. The Immigration Appeal Division dismissed the appeal finding that the medical evidence supported the decision to reject the application. Barnash applied for judicial review but the court ultimately denied the application.
