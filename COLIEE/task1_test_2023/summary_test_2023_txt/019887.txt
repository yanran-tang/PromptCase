A citizen of Afghanistan seeking Convention refugee status was denied due to complicity in crimes against humanity by working for the secret police the Khad. The applicant had claimed that their minimal involvement did not warrant exclusion under article 1(F)(a) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. However the Federal Court of Canada Trial Division dismissed the application concluding that the applicant had the requisite knowledge and did not extricate themselves from Khad at the earliest possible opportunity.
