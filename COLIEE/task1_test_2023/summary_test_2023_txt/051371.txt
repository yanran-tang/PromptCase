A citizen of Ukraine seeks judicial review of a decision by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board finding him not to be a Convention refugee. The applicant was homosexually raped and is persecuted due to perception of homosexuality in Ukraine which is a crime. The Board erred by claiming there was no evidence he was homosexual and by speculating about the country's laws. The application was allowed and the matter returned to a similarly constituted Board.
