A group of North Dakota towns and cities are pursuing an action against the Canadian government and four municipalities alleging flooding damage caused by the operation of a dike near the border between the United States and Canada. The plaintiffs seek to amend their claim to include the tort of interference with economic relations and damage claims for loss of tax revenue due to a decrease in the value of lands which allegedly flooded. The Canadian defendants are resisting these amendments on the grounds that they do not recognize a claim for pure economic loss. The plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Manitoba and the Canadian federal government sought to amend their Statement of Claim to include damages in excess of $50000 caused by the intentional and/or negligent acts and/or nuisance of the defendants. However Prothonotary Lafrenière denied the amendments concluding that the facts did not meet the requirements of the tort of interference with economic relations and that legal authority and policy considerations excluded liability for the economic loss.
