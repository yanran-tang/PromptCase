This case is about an appeal of the decision by a Citizenship Judge to refuse a Mexican citizen's application for Canadian citizenship due to insufficient residency requirements. The applicant argued that the decision was deficient and ignored evidence but the Federal Court ultimately dismissed the appeal finding that the Citizenship Judge applied the appropriate residency test and provided sufficient reasons for the decision. The issue was solely whether the applicant met the residency requirements and evidence of ties to Canada was not relevant to the physical presence test.
