This case is about a Sri Lankan citizen who arrived in Canada in 2008 and claimed refugee status due to his fear of persecution by the Tamil drug gang and the LTTE in Sri Lanka. He claimed he was threatened after a violent brawl in which he intervened and confronted two Tamil youths. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed his claim in 2009. This application was a judicial review of that decision.The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dismissed the applicant's refugee claim due to the lack of credibility of the evidence provided. The RPD concluded that the alleged risks were generalized and the existence of an IFA in Colombo meant that the applicant would not face persecution if returned to Sri Lanka. The decision was made under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) which grants protection to Convention refugees.
