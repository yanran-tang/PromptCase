Harbans Singh Uppal Manjit Kaur and their three children sought judicial review of a decision refusing their applications for permanent residence through family sponsorship. Although they initially misrepresented their familial relationships the applicants claimed that the misrepresentation had been withdrawn before a decision was made. However the court found that the immigration officer did not err in refusing their applications and that the misrepresentations could have induced an error in the administration of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The application for judicial review was dismissed.
