The Canadian Rehabilitation Council also known as The March of Dimes filed a judicial review application to overturn the decision of the Registrar of Trademarks to issue public notices allowing the use of the marks March of Dimes and Ontario March of Dimes by the Rehabilitation Foundation for the Disabled. The National Council argued that the Ontario Foundation was not entitled to use these marks independently but under license from them. The court agreed and granted the application.The court is considering whether to overturn the Registrar's decision to issue a public notice for the official marks March of Dimes and Ontario March of Dimes to the respondent the Ontario March of Dimes Foundation. The court allows for fresh evidence to be presented and the appropriate standard of review depends on whether the evidence would have materially affected the Registrar's decision. The court considers the history of the relationship between the parties and ultimately determines that the Registrar's decision should be overturned.
