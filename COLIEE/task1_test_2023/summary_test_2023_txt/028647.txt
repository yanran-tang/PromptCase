The case involves a dispute over the validity of an election for the Lower Similkameen Indian Band Council in March 1994. The defendants claim that the election was not conducted in accordance with the Customs Election Regulations and that they filed an appeal which the plaintiffs deny. The plaintiffs seek to strike out the defendants' Counterclaim on jurisdictional grounds arguing that the Federal Court lacks jurisdiction because the defendants did not exhaust all their remedies before coming to court. However the judge dismisses the plaintiff's motion as it is unclear whether an appeal was filed and whether the Election Appeal Board was adequate in this case. It is up to the trial judge to determine whether to grant the remedies sought by the defendants.
