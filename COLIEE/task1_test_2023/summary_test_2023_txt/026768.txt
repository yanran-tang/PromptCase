The applicant a citizen of China seeks to overturn a decision by Canadian officials that denied his application for permanent residency in Canada. He had applied in 1987 and although he had passed his interview and medical tests there were delays due to security checks. In December 1988 he sent a $500 Christmas card to an immigration programme officer who he felt had been helpful which triggered an investigation and interview with a Consul at the Canadian Consulate. The applicant believes that he was unfairly denied permanent residency due to the $500 payment.The applicant Mr. Chen had his permanent residence application denied by a Senior Immigration Officer Mr. Spunt due to him allegedly lying to an immigration officer and Mr. Spunt exercising his discretion under s. 11(3) of the Immigration Regulations. This decision was made with the approval of Senior Immigration Officer Mr. Nauman. The delay in processing Mr. Chen's application potentially caused frustration and desperation for the applicant and his family.
