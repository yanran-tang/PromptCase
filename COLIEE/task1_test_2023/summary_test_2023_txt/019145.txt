The Canadian Intellectual Property Office has decided to expunge trademark ARBOUR & DESIGN from the Trademarks Register due to the applicant's failure to provide evidence of use in response to a notice and so the applicant has appealed under section 56 of the Trade-marks Act. While the appeal has been allowed in part registration has been maintained with amendments to only include unbleached cotton shopping bags other wares and services having been deleted.
