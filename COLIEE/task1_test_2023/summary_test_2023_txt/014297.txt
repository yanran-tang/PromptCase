Mr. Douglas Dillon who had worked as a mill-worker suffered a massive heart attack in 1988 limiting his ability to work. He received disability benefits under the Canada Pension Plan which were discontinued in 1998 after medical reports suggested he had improved. In 2004 he made a second application for disability benefits and was successful in obtaining them in 2005. He appealed for an extension of the retroactive period but was informed that the Minister had no jurisdiction to do so. The Review Tribunal dismissed his appeal in 2007.Mr. Dillon sought to have the court order the Minister to rescind the cease order of his disability benefits and reinstate them as of December 1997 or refer the decision back to the Minister for proper consideration. However the court found that the matter was res judicata and there was no error in law in the Minister's decision to limit retroactive payments to the statutory limitation period. The standard of review for CPP disability benefits is patent unreasonableness but the Minister's decision to rescind and extend retroactive payments is a question of jurisdiction and reviewed on a standard of correctness.
