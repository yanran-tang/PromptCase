Pfizer Canada Inc. and Pfizer Corporation have applied for an order to prohibit the issuance of a Notice of Compliance for fluconazole tablets to Apotex Inc. until Canadian Letters Patent 1181076 expires. Apotex alleges that the Pfizer Patent is not valid and that their manufacturing process will not infringe on it. Two related proceedings by Pfizer for Nu-Pharm's Notice of Compliance for fluconazole raise similar issues. Fluconazole is an anti-fungal drug used to treat serious systemic and superficial infections.The Court is considering the validity of the Pfizer Patent for the pharmaceutical fluconazole including claims for the synthesis of the drug and its chemical equivalents. Apotex is arguing that the invention was not new or was obvious citing a prior Canadian patent. The Court must apply tests for anticipation novelty and obviousness and consider the onus of proof and presumption of validity for patents under Canadian law. The Court's decision in this case will have implications for the pharmaceutical industry and patent law.In patent law anticipation occurs when a prior publication contains all the information needed to produce a claimed invention without using any inventive skill. The publication must give clear and unmistakable directions that would lead a skilled person to the claimed invention without any possibility of error. Evidence of prior knowledge or use should be scrutinized and a weighty burden falls on anyone claiming anticipation. Anticipation requires that the publication contains clear instructions to do or make something that would infringe the patent in suit if carried after grant.
