The applicant requested an extension of time to file their application record for a leave request and judicial review of an immigration officer's decision. The reason given was that their counsel was going out of town and unable to complete the record before her departure. The judge refused the request for an extension due to the personal schedule of counsel not being an acceptable reason. The counsel then filed a motion for reconsideration which was dismissed as there was no unanticipated cause for the delay. The judge stated that time limits in the courts are meant to be complied with and only reasonable grounds beyond the control of counsel or applicant can be considered for an extension of time.
