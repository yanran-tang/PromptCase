Gregory McMaster currently an inmate at the Fenbrook Institution sought a declaration that the Correctional Service of Canada continues to record inaccurate information on the Applicant's files in breach of its statutory obligation to record only accurate up-to-date and complete information pursuant to section 24 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. But his application was dismissed by the court as he had failed to exhaust the internal grievance procedure available to him. McMaster who is eligible for parole in the United States does not wish to apply until misleading information in his Correctional Service of Canada files are removed.The internal grievance process for inmates within Canadian corrections includes written complaints appeals to higher authority and referrals to an inmate grievance committee or outside review board. The process must be dealt with expeditiously and inmates can seek judicial review if dissatisfied with the final decision. The accuracy of information in an offender's file is essential for release decision-making and offenders can request corrections to their file under subsection 24(2) of the Act.Mr. McMaster has requested for inaccurate and misleading information in his correctional file to be corrected citing that the information jeopardizes his chances of release and is a violation of his constitutional rights. While he argues that the Correctional Service of Canada has a duty to ensure accurate information and act fairly towards inmates the court may decline jurisdiction if there is an adequate alternative remedy such as the internal grievance procedure under the Act.
