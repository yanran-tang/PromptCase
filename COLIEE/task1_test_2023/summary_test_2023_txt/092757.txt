The case of Murugiah a former resident of Colombo Sri Lanka who claimed he had a well-founded fear of persecution should he return to Sri Lanka was reviewed. Murugiah's appeal which stated that he was not recognised as a Convention refugee was rejected due to the board's findings on his arrests which were initially made as part of general law enforcement procedures. A question of general importance was certified as to whether 'persecution' requires systematic and persistent acts or whether a single or a couple of violations of basic and inalienable rights is enough to constitute 'persecution'.
