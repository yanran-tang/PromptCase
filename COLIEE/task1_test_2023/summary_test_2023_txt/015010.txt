The case concerns an Estonian mother Ljudmilla Pehtereva and her two children who claimed to be Convention refugees in Canada due to fearing persecution in Estonia for reasons of nationality religion political opinion and membership in a particular social group. The Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board found that they were not Convention refugees a decision that was upheld in a judicial review application as the applicants failed to prove that the state of Estonia was unable or unwilling to protect them.
