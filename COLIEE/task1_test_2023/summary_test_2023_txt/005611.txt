This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board which found that the applicant a native of China was not a Convention refugee based on fear of persecution for political opinion and membership in a particular social group. The Board accepted the applicant's evidence of past involvement in pro-democracy activities but did not find his fear of future persecution credible citing implausibilities in his evidence and low incidence of political persecution in Guangdong Province. The Board also found the applicant's involvement in Canadian protests minimal and insignificant.The case involves a Chinese national named Henry Cai seeking refugee status in Canada. The applicant claims that he was involved in protests against the Chinese government and feared persecution if he returned. However the Canadian immigration board denied his application due to lack of credibility. The applicant appealed the decision arguing that the board violated procedural fairness by failing to call a witness and reneging on an undertaking. A consent judicial review judgment was granted setting aside the board's decision and referred the matter back for a new hearing.
