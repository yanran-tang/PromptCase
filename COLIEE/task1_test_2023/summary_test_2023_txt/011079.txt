This case involves an application for judicial review by a citizen of Ecuador seeking refugee status in Canada. The applicant alleges persecution by the FARC a Colombian rebel group due to his refusal to provide information about his students at a private military academy where he taught. The panel's decision was based solely on the availability of state protection in Ecuador without addressing the applicant's credibility or the plausibility of his account. The Federal Court judge found that the analysis of subjective fear of persecution should precede the availability of state protection and referred the matter back to the Immigration and Refugee Board for rehearing.
