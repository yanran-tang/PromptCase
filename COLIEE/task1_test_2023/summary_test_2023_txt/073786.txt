This is a case about an application for leave and judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board dismissing the Applicants' appeal from their departure orders. Mr. Chang and his family citizens of Taiwan were issued a Quebec Selection Certificate in the entrepreneur category in May 1998 but it was later discovered that they had entered into a front operation or a sham investment. The judge emphasized the importance of the integrity of the immigration system and the consequences of flaunting the conditions of the entrepreneur category.The Chang family who entered Canada under the entrepreneur category were deemed inadmissible for failing to comply with the conditions in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The parents and the three children were found to be in non-compliance with the act's subsections and sections including not complying with residency requirements. The family argued for special relief but the court upheld the decision stating that they did not respect the conditions of permanent residency.
