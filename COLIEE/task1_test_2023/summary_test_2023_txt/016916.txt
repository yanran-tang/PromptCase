The case concerns the denial of a permanent residence application for a financial auditor and accountant from India under the National Occupation Classification (NOC) 1111. The officer found that the applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence of at least one year of continuous full-time experience. The applicant argued the officer denied him procedural fairness but the court found that the officer was not under a duty to raise concerns about whether the principal applicant had satisfied the selection criteria for a visa. However the court found that the officer's reasons were inadequate to explain why the similarity between the contents of the employer's letter and the NOC was problematic and the officer denied the principal applicant procedural fairness. Consequently the court allowed the application for judicial review set aside the officer's decision and referred the matter to a different officer for redetermination.
