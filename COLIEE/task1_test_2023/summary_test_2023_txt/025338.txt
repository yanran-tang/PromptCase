The case involves a citizen of China who applied for permanent residency in Canada in the occupation of Interpreter but was refused due to her lack of a bachelor's degree in Translation. The visa officer's decision was found to be in error as she had misinterpreted the employment requirements for an Interpreter in the National Occupational Classification and had applied a different requirement than what was required by the NOC. The court also expressed concerns regarding visa officers assessing employment skills of applicants. The matter was referred back for determination by a different visa officer.
