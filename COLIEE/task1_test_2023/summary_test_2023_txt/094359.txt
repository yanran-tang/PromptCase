An application for judicial review of a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) decision denying a Mexican woman's application for protection was denied. The applicant's refugee claim had previously been rejected and her first PRRA was quashed due to a failure to make an independent evaluation of the evidence. The second PRRA was also rejected.A woman applied for refugee protection in Canada due to threats from her abusive ex-partner in Mexico. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denied her claim in 2005 and a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) officer denied her second PRRA in 2009. The officer questioned the credibility of the new evidence provided and found that an internal flight alternative (IFA) existed concluding that the woman did not meet the requirements for protection under IRPA. Section 96 of IRPA provides protection to Convention refugees.
