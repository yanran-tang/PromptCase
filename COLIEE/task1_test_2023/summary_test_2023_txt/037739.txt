The case involves a Chinese convert to Christianity who claimed refugee status in Canada due to fear of persecution. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) dismissed his claim finding him not credible. The Federal Court quashed the RPD's decision finding it patently unreasonable due to a series of unsupported or poorly reasoned findings. The matter was remitted to be heard by a differently constituted panel.
