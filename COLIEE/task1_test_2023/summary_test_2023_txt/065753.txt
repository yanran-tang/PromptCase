The case concerns a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) application rejected by a PRRA Officer which the judge found to have been improperly conducted. The judge found that the officer had failed to properly consider new evidence had arbitrarily discarded relevant evidence and had made reviewable errors. As a result the judge allowed the application and referred the matter back for redetermination by another officer.
