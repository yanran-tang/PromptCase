The case involves an application for judicial review to overturn a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board that the applicant a Kurdish citizen of Iraq is not a Convention refugee. The Board found that an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) existed in northern Iraq under the control of the Kurds and therefore the applicant had no grounds for fearing persecution. The applicant argues that the Board erred in its assessment of changed circumstances in Iraq and the stability of the Kurdish regime but the court finds that the Board's decision was not based on findings of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner and therefore dismisses the application. No questions were certified for consideration by the Court of Appeal.
