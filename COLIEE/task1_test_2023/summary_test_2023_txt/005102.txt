The applicant sought a judicial review of a decision by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Canada which refused to reconsider its decision not to grant him a disability pension for an injury sustained during his training in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1964. Despite obtaining medical opinions from two doctors the court ruled that the Board's decision was reasonable and dismissed the application for judicial review.
