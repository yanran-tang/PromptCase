Apotex sought judicial review of the Minister of Health's decision to refuse to issue a Notice of Compliance for their version of aspirin. The application dealt with Apotex's Abbreviated New Drug Submission for acetylsalicylic acid enteric-coated tablets. The major issue in dispute was the exclusion of data in the fed study which did not meet the Minister's bioequivalence standards. Apotex argued that the reference drug was defective and excluded the results of two subjects from the data analysis which the Minister refused to accept.Apotex filed an application seeking a Notice of Compliance (NOC) from the Therapeutic Products Directorate (TPD) for their version of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) but the TPD denied it due to the failure to prove bioequivalence. Apotex requested a reconsideration but the NON was upheld. The Minister confirmed that no NOC would be issued stating that the product's safety and efficacy had not been proven according to the TPD's bioequivalence standards. Apotex then filed a judicial review on the Minister's decision raising issues of fettering discretion intelligibility of reasons and unfairness in the system.
