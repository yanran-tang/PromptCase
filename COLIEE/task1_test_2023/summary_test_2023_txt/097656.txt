Kirgan Holding S.A filed a claim in a Canadian court against The Owners and all Others Interested in the Ship PANAMAX LEADER for payment of bunker fuel supplied. The ship in question was registered under the Maltese flag managed by a Greek company and owned by Pacific Pearl Co. Ltd. Tonga Shipping Inc. was the bareboat charterer who ordered the fuel from Kirgan. The contract between the two specified the US law as the choice of law. The plaintiff holds that they have a maritime lien on the defendants for unpaid necessaries.The plaintiff sues the defendants for the cost of bunkers supplied to a ship arguing that they owe the plaintiff due to a maritime lien under the Maritime Liens Act. The defendants deny being party to the plaintiff's contract and argue that US maritime law provides no lien in this case. The court must determine whether the bunkers were delivered on the credit of the ship and whether the plaintiff is entitled to a maritime lien. The court analyzes the choice of law clause and the evidence presented at trial to make its findings.
