The applicants in this case were seeking judicial review of a decision made by RCMP training leaders to award them an unsatisfactory rating thereby making them ineligible for employment. The applicants argued that they were not given adequate notice of the proposed change to their rating but the court found that they had received sufficient notice and opportunity to respond. The court also found that the training program's assessment procedures provided a proper balance between the Training Academy's interest in determining aptitude and the applicants' right to fairness. The application was dismissed.
