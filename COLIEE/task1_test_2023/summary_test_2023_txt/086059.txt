Abbott Laboratories and Abbot Laboratories Limited have brought a motion to strike certain portions of affidavits filed by Novopharm Limited claiming they are based on inadmissible hearsay evidence. The applicants' challenge focuses on four Exhibits - D E F and G - and seeks to strike them on the grounds they expand upon allegations of fact set out in the Notice of Allegation. The Respondent argues the evidence put forward meets the test for admissibility of hearsay evidence adding that any potential expansion of allegations should be left to the trial judge.
