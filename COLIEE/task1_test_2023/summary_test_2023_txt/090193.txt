In this case an inmate serving an indeterminate sentence as a dangerous offender appeals the National Parole Board's decision to deny parole claiming that the Board had lost jurisdiction over him by failing to hold a timely hearing. The inmate also raises issues related to the CSC's failure to provide disclosure and potential violations of procedural fairness and the principles of fundamental justice. The Appeal Division dismissed the appeal finding that the NPB had not lost jurisdiction and had not committed any errors of law or procedural fairness.The court analyzes the standard of review for the Appeal Division and concludes that its decisions should be given considerable deference. However for certain questions related to jurisdiction or natural justice correctness review is appropriate. The most serious issue raised by the Applicant concerns the failure of the National Parole Board to hold a review within the two-year time frame mandated by statute which may have resulted in a loss of jurisdiction to hold a parole review at all. The court reviews the legislative scheme governing the review of indeterminate sentences.The Corrections and Conditional Release Act outlines the procedures for the National Parole Board (NPB) to grant parole to offenders incarcerated for indeterminate sentences. The NPB has exclusive jurisdiction over granting parole and may review applications for day and full parole. Reviews may be adjourned and the Board may grant day parole or defer the decision for specific reasons. The duration of adjournments should be as short as possible. Semi-liberty may also be granted and reviews for full parole may be conducted every two years for offenders serving two years or more who are not within provincial parole board jurisdiction.
