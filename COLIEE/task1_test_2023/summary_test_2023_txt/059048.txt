Mikhail Anaschenko a Russian citizen who claimed refugee status in Canada on the grounds of Jewish ethnicity had his application for permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate (H & C) grounds rejected by a H & C Officer who stated that there were no H & C grounds to exempt Anaschenko from visa requirements under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Anaschenko sought a judicial review of the decision arguing that the H & C Officer failed to consider the best interests of his son and gave a patently unreasonable risk assessment. However the court found no reviewable error and dismissed Anaschenko's application.
