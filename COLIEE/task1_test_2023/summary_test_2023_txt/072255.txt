In this judicial review citizens of Libya sought to challenge a negative pre-removal risk assessment decision made by an officer. The court determined that the applicants were not allowed to raise arguments based on the Charter constitution and international convention for the first time in their further memorandum of fact and law. The officer's decision was reasonable and not required to hold an interview with Mr. Al Mansuri. The officer did not deprive the applicants of the opportunity to present their case and the officer's credibility or plausibility findings were not perverse. Lastly the officer did not err in considering the interests of the applicants' Canadian-born children.Leave was granted to an applicant for relief who argued that their statutory and common-law right to natural justice were denied due to a lack of interview and the officer's emphasis on peripheral evidence. In a further memorandum of fact and law the applicant raised issues related to constitutional rights and argued that the deportation of a parent of Canadian-born children interferes with their rights to parent-child relationships and custody and access to their children. The applicant also argued that there is a constitutional omission in such cases.The case involves the denial of the parent-child relationship and interference with the rights and duties of parents regarding Canadian children based on family affiliation and nationality. The applicants argue that this violates their Charter rights but the Minister argues that new issues were improperly raised and the applicants failed to file a required notice of constitutional question. The court rejects the applicants' argument and denies their request to adjourn noting that the Supreme Court's decision in the Native Women's Association case is not determinative of the question.
