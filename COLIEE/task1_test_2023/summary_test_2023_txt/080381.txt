This judicial review concerns Canadian citizens imprisoned in the US seeking to serve in Canada the remainder of their sentence. The cases deal with whether s. 6 of the Charter is breached due to the International Transfer of Offenders Act and if the Minister's decisions were reasonable. The Act's purpose is to contribute to justice administration offender rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The Applicants argued that public safety and security should not be considered in administration of justice but the court found this argument too narrow.The Canadian government has been given the authority to transfer Canadian prisoners from foreign countries back to their own country through the International Transfer of Offenders Act. The act was challenged in court by two Canadian prisoners who wanted to be transferred from the United States to Canada. The court ultimately found that the Minister of Public Safety had acted reasonably in denying their transfer due to concerns regarding public safety and security. The court also emphasized that the factors listed in the act were not necessarily exhaustive and that the Minister could consider other relevant factors.
