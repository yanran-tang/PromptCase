Mr. Teeluck is seeking a judicial review and an order setting aside an adjudicator's decision that upheld the employer's decision to end his employment for sexually harassing a fellow worker. The incident happened in November 1996 at the Atlantic Institution in New Brunswick. The complainant alleged that Mr. Teeluck touched her breast and made inappropriate comments but Mr. Teeluck denied the allegations. The issues raised in the application concern the appropriate standard of review and the adjudicator's decision.In November 1996 Mr. Teeluck was accused of sexually harassing a female co-worker at the Atlantic Institution. He denied the allegations and filed a complaint against her the following day. The institution's warden conducted an investigation and terminated Teeluck's employment in March 1997 finding him guilty of sexual harassment. Another employee came forward with a similar allegation. Teeluck had consistently denied involvement in the incident throughout the investigation.
