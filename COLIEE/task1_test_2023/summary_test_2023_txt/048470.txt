Defendants in a court case have requested a lump sum award in lieu of assessed taxable costs or alternatively an award of taxable fees. The lump sum sought consists of $150000 taxable disbursements of $22308.96 and fees paid to three experts totalling $80838.51. The court determined that the defendants bill of costs should be fixed at the upper end of Column IV of Tariff B with disbursements at $22308.96 and the experts' honorarium at $80838.51 but refused the request for a lump sum amount beyond Tariff B.
