The case involves an amended originating motion by the applicant seeking to challenge the respondent's policy that precludes the selection of individuals for peacekeeping duties based on ethnic racial or religious considerations. The respondent seeks to strike out the motion arguing that the applicant lacks standing the affidavit does not comply with rules and that the matter is not suitable for summary disposition. The court exercises its discretion and strikes out the applicant's motion allowing them to bring an action by way of statement of claim.
