The case involves an applicant from Saint-Vincent and the Grenadines who claimed refugee protection due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on her sexual orientation and a risk to her life or cruel treatment based on being assaulted by her boyfriend. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board found that she had not met the burden of establishing that the state was not capable of protecting her and that there was an Internal Flight Alternative available. However the Federal Court found that the Board made reviewable errors and referred the matter for redetermination.
