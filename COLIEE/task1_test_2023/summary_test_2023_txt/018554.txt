The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration applied for judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division which found that Ronald Gomes' pre-sentencing custody did not form part of his term of imprisonment for the purposes of determining serious criminality. The court found that the Board failed to consider Gomes' pre-sentencing custody in determining the application of subsection 64(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and allowed the application for judicial review referring the matter back to a differently constituted panel for reconsideration.
