The case concerns an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which denied refugee status to a journalist who feared persecution in his home country. The court found that the panel did not consider all the evidence and applied an incorrect standard of review. The case was referred for reconsideration by a new panel.
