The applicant Joshua Taiwo Adjani seeks judicial review after being denied his appeal for his son's sponsorship by the Immigration and Refugee Board. The visa officer refused to grant his son a permanent visa as the applicant did not declare the child as his dependent at the time of processing or landing in Canada. The applicant filed an appeal but was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The applicant raises issues regarding the violation of his Charter rights the vires of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act Regulation and the decision rendered by the board being unreasonable.t argues that the application of paragraph 117(9)(d) of the Regulations violates his son's Charter rights under s. 15(1) as he is being treated differently due to his lineage. The Respondent denies this argument stating that the provision makes no distinction based on lineage but rather on timely disclosure. The standard of review is correctness for interpreting the regulation and related provisions and reasonableness simpliciter for applying them to the facts. The court will apply a three-part test to determine if the enactment violates the s. 15(1) Charter right.
