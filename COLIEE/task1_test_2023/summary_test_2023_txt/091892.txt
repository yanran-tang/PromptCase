The case involves Mr. Haji Diadama who is seeking refugee status in Canada on the grounds of religious persecution and his parents' forcing him to marry a woman he does not love. The panel found Mr. Diadama's claim not credible due to a lack of documentary evidence to support his claims particularly about forced marriage practices in Liberia. The court dismissed his application for judicial review stating that the panel was entitled to draw a negative inference as to his credibility based on the missing documentation.
