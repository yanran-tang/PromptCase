The plaintiff in this case appealed a decision made by the Tax Court of Canada which upheld notices of reassessment from the Minister of National Revenue for the plaintiff's 1978-1981 taxation years. The Minister deemed the plaintiff to be a class (2) farmer and limited their farming losses to $5000 yearly. The issue was whether the plaintiff was a class (1) or class (2) farmer and the court ultimately found that the plaintiff's chief source of income was teaching and possibly something else rather than farming and dismissed the appeal.
