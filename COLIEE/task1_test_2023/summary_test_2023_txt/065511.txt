Hassan Isse Ali a citizen of Somalia who has never lived in Somalia and does not have family living there was denied Convention refugee status. He appealed this decision on several grounds including that the tribunal did not provide adequate reasons for its decision and ignored significant evidence supporting his claim. The court allowed the application for judicial review set aside the decision of the tribunal and referred the matter back to the Refugee Division for reconsideration by a different panel. No questions were certified for consideration by the Court of Appeal.
