The defendant's vice-president had a meeting with Angelo Risi the inventor of a patented retaining wall block in 1990. The defendant is now being sued for infringement of this patent. The issue is whether plaintiffs' counsel has a conflict of interest due to a consultation with a patent agent related to them who was present at the 1990 meeting.Ciccarello consulted patent agents to determine if the Omni block was covered by Patent 295. He had three meetings with Antoine Gauvin of the firm during which he disclosed that Techo Bloc manufactured paving and retaining blocks was planning to produce the Omni block and considering a license agreement with Risi Stone Ltd. Ciccarello admitted that this information was already in the public domain in 1993.
