The case revolves around the judicial review application filed by the applicant against the Toronto Port Authority's decision regarding Jazz Air's operation at the Toronto Island Airport. The prothonotary struck out the applicant's application on the ground of abuse of process since it was based on the same facts and issues as an earlier discontinued application. The applicant sought an appeal against this decision.In 2006 Jazz Air applied to resume flights at the Toronto Island Airport (TIA). Negotiations with the respondent continued on a without prejudice basis until Jazz Air negotiated another leasing arrangement in July. However the respondent refused to allow Jazz Air to resume operations at the TIA and Jazz Air discontinued their first application and commenced a narrower second one in August. The prothonotary determined that Jazz Air had abused the process by dropping some allegations but continuing litigation over the same commercial dispute with the Toronto Port Authority.The case involves an airline's application for judicial review against a policy by the operator of an airport. The prothonotary ruled that the airline's second application constituted an abuse of process because it was factually and legally similar to the first application taken specifically to avoid a case management order. The applicant disputes this but evidence shows that there is little difference in the substance between the two applications. The issue of whether the application is time-barred was not addressed by the prothonotary.
