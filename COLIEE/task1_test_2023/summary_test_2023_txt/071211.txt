The defendants in a dispute over an insurance claim have appealed a decision regarding solicitor-client privilege on a document marked as Exhibit A1 in an examination of discovery. The plaintiffs sought indemnity from the defendants for fees incurred in a government claim to which the defendants refused their insurance claim leading to the current proceedings. Prothonotary Lafreni√®re concluded that the document was privileged and ordered the defendants to return it and not use it as evidence in the current proceedings. The defendants claim that there was no privilege as the communication was purely factual.
