The applicants seek to prevent their removal to Israel through a motion for injunction with the removal officer having found there is no grounds for deferral due to their lack of risk in Israel and the potential for their medical issues to be addressed there. The Applicants have failed to meet the requirements of the tripartite test for an injunction as they have not raised any serious issues suffer no irreparable harm and the balance of convenience favors the Respondent. The motion for an order to stay the removal was dismissed.
