The Federal Court has granted Juan Camilo Nino Silva a right to be heard in a refugee case after finding that the judge was not justified in excluding him from a hearing when he was 17 years old. Juan's parents had applied for new passports and traveled to Colombia three times leading to a presumption they had voluntarily re-availed themselves of their birth country's protection resulting in their refugee status being lost. The decision will be referred back to a differently constituted panel.
