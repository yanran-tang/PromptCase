ial review was granted to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in a case involving a refugee determination in which the Respondent Jennifer Pearce was found to be a Convention refugee. The Minister sought to vacate the decision due to alleged misrepresentations and withholding of material facts but the board dismissed the application. The case involves the exclusion of documentary evidence and the lack of attendance by the Respondent at the hearing.The Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board acknowledged that information about a refugeeâ€™s return to Jamaica and her subsequent arrest for possession of cocaine would have had a profound effect on her reasoning. However the board declined to vacate the initial positive refugee determination citing the respondent's lack of education and life experience and faulting Citizenship and Immigration Canada for not bringing relevant information to the attention of the First Panel. Section 109 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act prescribes the authority of the board in determining applications to vacate positive refugee decisions.
