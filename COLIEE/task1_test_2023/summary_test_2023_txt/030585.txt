rael as a conscientious objector? The Immigration and Refugee Board found the principal applicant lacked credibility and was not a conscientious objector. The Federal Court upheld the Board's decision stating that compulsory military service is not persecution and there was no evidence of the applicant being asked to carry out violations of international humanitarian law. The court also found that civilians harmed during military operations were an ugly fact of battle and violators of human rights were punished meaning conscientious objectors would not be forced to participate in human rights abuses.This legal analysis examines whether the applicant who deserted the army due to being a conscientious objector is eligible for refugee status under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The analysis notes that military evasion is generally not sufficient grounds for refugee status but there are exceptions if there is discrimination or bias related to a Convention ground or if the military action violates basic human rights. The analysis concludes that the applicant did not meet the criteria for refugee status as a conscientious objector.
