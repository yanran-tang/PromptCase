This case involves two appeals brought under Rule 51 of the Federal Courts Rules both challenging an Order of the Prothonotary in an action concerning the regulatory scheme for new drugs in Canada. The first appeal concerns Teva Canada Inc.'s claim for damages for permanent loss of market share and the second appeal concerns Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc. and Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH's motion to dismiss the Teva Counterclaim. The Prothonotary's decision was issued on February 12 2010 and the case is being specially managed.Teva has counterclaimed against Sanofi Canada and Sanofi Germany for damages under Section 8 of the Canadian Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations due to Sanofi Canada gaining market exclusivity for its ramipril drug. Teva alleges that it lost permanent market share during the period of automatic stay because Sanofi Canada engaged in illegal tactics. Teva is seeking damages for its loss of sales and market share.
