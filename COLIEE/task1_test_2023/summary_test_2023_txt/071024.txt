This is the story of Azucena Margarita Ramos Ramirez and her four children two of whom were born in Canada one in El Salvador and one in the US. Ramirez is facing deportation with her non-Canadian daughter Jessie. Though a pre-removal risk assessment was denied the humanitarian and compassionate application was granted. Ramirez was deported in 2004 with two of her children but husband was left behind in El Salvador with their eldest son.An immigrant family from El Salvador including two daughters who were sexually harassed by a gang and a son born in Canada were denied refugee status in Canada. The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) argued that police in El Salvador were trying to address gang violence and the family had not shown enough evidence to explain why they would not be safe once they left Quetzaltepeque. The family filed for humanitarian and compassionate leave and argued that separation would be a hardship for their children.
