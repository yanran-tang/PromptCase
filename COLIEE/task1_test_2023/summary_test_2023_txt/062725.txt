The court considers the legality of paragraph 117(9)(d) of Canada's immigration regulations which denies entry to non-accompanying family members of a sponsor who were not examined by an officer. The court finds that the regulation is not ultra vires (beyond one's legal power or authority) and family reunification is not the only objective of Canada's immigration policy. The court also affirms that non-disclosure regardless of intention warrants exclusion under the regulation.This is a judicial review case regarding Buong Nguyen's application to reinstate a previously withdrawn appeal to sponsor his daughter under the Family Class. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations prohibit non-disclosed family members from being sponsored. The court found the impugned regulation to be valid but that an application for ministerial exemption on compassionate grounds is available to Mr. Nguyen. The discretion to grant the exemption lies with the Minister and not the judiciary.The case revolves around a foreign national Mr. Nguyen who failed to disclose the existence of his daughter during his immigration application for permanent residency. The Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) denied his application citing that Mr. Nguyen did not fit the group identified as disadvantaged by paragraph 117(9)( d ) of the immigration legislation. The IAD also argued that Federal Court jurisprudence indicated that the legislation did not contemplate subjective knowledge of a non-disclosed family member.
