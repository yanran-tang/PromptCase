The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) that J. Gibson was not a convention refugee as defined under the Immigration Act. The decision was based on a lack of credibility by the applicant who claimed forced sterilization and persecution due to violating the one-child policy in China. The court dismissed the application for judicial review and declined to certify a question regarding the use of Port of Entry notes in determining an applicant's credibility.
