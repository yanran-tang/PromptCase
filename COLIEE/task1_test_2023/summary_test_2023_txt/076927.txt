This case involves an application for judicial review of the April 7 2011 decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board refusing the applicants' claim for refugee protection due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on their ethnicity. The RPD rejected the claim finding that the discrimination suffered by the applicants did not amount to persecution and that state protection was available to them. The court's analysis concluded that the RPD did not err in law and therefore dismissed the application for judicial review.
