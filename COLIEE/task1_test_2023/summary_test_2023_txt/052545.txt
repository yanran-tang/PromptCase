This is a judicial review of a decision by the Assistant Director of the Windsor Tax Services Offices refusing to vacate a lien held by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) against the equity of a warehouse property belonging to the Applicant 893134 Ontario Inc. The Applicant is a wholesaler to convenience stores and carries on business under the name Mega Distributors. The Applicant was assessed for uncollected and unremitted Goods and Services Tax (GST) due under the Excise Tax Act together with penalties and interest for a total of $767354.52. The Applicant has initiated proceedings in the Tax Court of Canada with respect to the assessment and collection action by CRA. The Head Office upheld the assessment and requested payment failing which collection action will be taken.In 2003 a collection action against the Applicant was halted as they planned to appeal the assessment to the Tax Court. The Assistant Director registered a memorial to protect the Crown's position after the Applicant did not provide security for the debt. In 2007 the Applicant requested for CRAâ€™s lien to be lifted in order to secure a mortgage but was denied by the Assistant Director. The Applicant argued that the Assistant Director breached the duty of fairness by failing to consider relevant factors when making the decision. The standard of review for this issue is correctness.
