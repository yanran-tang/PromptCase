The case involves an applicant from Hungary who arrived in Canada in 2003 alleging a fear of persecution due to two sexual assaults by her former fianc√©. The Refugee Protection Division denied the applicant's claim citing unreliable evidence. However the presiding member's questioning was found to be inappropriate and laden with irrelevant issues that irreparably tainted the applicant's right to a fair hearing. The Court ordered a rehearing and redetermination of the case.
