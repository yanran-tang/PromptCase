Kenny Merceron a citizen of Haiti sought refugee protection in Canada after working for the Haitian National Police from 1999 to 2003. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) excluded Merceron under Article 1F(a) and (c) of the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The RPD concluded that although crimes against humanity were involved in the Haitian National Police and Chim√®res Merceron could not be regarded as complicit in those crimes. The court found that the RPD made a reviewable error and remitted the case for reconsideration by a different panel.
