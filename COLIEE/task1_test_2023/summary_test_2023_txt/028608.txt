The court rules that the defendant is entitled to security for costs and sets the amount at $50000 payable within 45 days due to the plaintiff being an American resident with no known roots or assets in Canada. The court considers the defendant's projected costs and disbursements and the possibility of settlement before trial. The plaintiff's proceedings are stayed until security for costs is provided.
