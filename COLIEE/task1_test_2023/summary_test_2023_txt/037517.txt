Nixon Valère’s refugee claim was rejected by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board due to his alleged complicity in crimes against humanity committed by the Haitian National Police. Valère denies any wrongdoing and seeks to have the decision set aside arguing that the evidence did not support the Board’s findings. The Federal Court of Canada has ruled in Valère’s favor stating that there was no evidence of his direct involvement in the crimes and rejecting the Board’s inference of complicity based on his low ranking in the force. The matter has been remitted to a differently constituted panel for redetermination.
