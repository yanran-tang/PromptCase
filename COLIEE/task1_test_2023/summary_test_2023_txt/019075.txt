Lilly is seeking to amend their statement of claim in a patent infringement suit against Apotex's drug Apo-Cefaclor. The disputed amendment concerns Lilly's request for solicitor and client costs and exemplary damages due to Apotex allegedly withholding relevant documents that caused additional expenses for the plaintiffs. The parties disagree on the relevance and reasonability of the amendment with Apotex arguing that it is frivolous and vexatious. The court will consider the potential prejudice and whether the amendment can withstand a motion to strike.Lilly argues that Apotex's failure to disclose documents is relevant to its plea of the common law burden of proof. However the court disagrees and states that the burden of proof would only shift to Apotex if the evidence was unavailable and it had special knowledge of the process at issue not based on their conduct. In addition Apotex argues that inappropriate conduct in litigation cannot be a basis for claiming exemplary or punitive damages and it would constitute impermissible double recovery if a party received both exemplary damages and solicitor and client costs for the same alleged conduct.
