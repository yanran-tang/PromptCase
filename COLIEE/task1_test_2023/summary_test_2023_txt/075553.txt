The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration appeals the decision of a citizenship judge who had approved the respondent's application for Canadian citizenship despite the fact that the respondent was physically present in Canada for only 406 days in the four years preceding the application. The minister submits that the Citizenship Judge erred in fact and law in allowing the application since the respondent did not fulfill the residency requirement. The court concludes that the Citizenship Judge erred in fact and law in finding that Canada is where the respondent regularly normally and customarily lives and his decision cannot be said to be reasonable.
