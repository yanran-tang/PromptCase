In a case where a citizen of Eritrea sought protection under the Immigration Refugee and Protection Act her claims for protection based on religious and political persecution were denied. The Immigration and Refugee Board found that she had failed to establish her status as a Jehovah Witness and that she had not made serious efforts to do so. Additionally the Board did not consider the risk of arbitrary detention and torture which is inflicted on those who refuse to serve in the military. Therefore the case was remitted for a new determination.
