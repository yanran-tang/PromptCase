Apotex sought to market tablets containing sildenafil which is used in Pfizer's medicine Viagra and other patents. Pfizer sought an order to prohibit the Minister of Health from issuing Apotex a Notice of Compliance which would allow them to market sildenafil tablets. The court found Pfizer failed to prove Apotex's allegations challenging the validity of their patent were unjustified. In proceedings of the Notice of Compliance Regulations the legal burden falls on the applicant to persuade the court while the respondent must put their allegations into play and adduce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of validity.The burden of proof on respondents in cases of alleged patent invalidity is an evidential burden to adduce evidence of invalidity. Once this burden is met the presumption of validity dissolves and the applicant must prove on a balance of probabilities that the allegations are unsupportable. If the respondent fails to provide enough evidence to persuade the court it runs the risk of losing its case. Pfizer bears the legal burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that Apotex's allegations of invalidity are unjustified while Apotex merely has an evidentiary burden to put its case into play.Pfizer's '748 patent covers a broad range of compounds with Apotex alleging that the number is 260 quintillion. However Pfizer argues that they only seek to protect one compound sildenafil. The patent covers the use of these compounds in the treatment of angina hypertension heart failure and atherosclerosis. The compounds in the patent have certain biochemical properties that may be useful in the treatment of a wide range of conditions by either increasing the supply of a first messenger or by curbing the effect of the PDE responsible for neutralizing the second messenger.
