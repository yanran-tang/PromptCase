This case involves a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo who was determined to be a Convention refugee but later had his refugee status challenged under section 108 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Board rejected his claim for refugee protection but the court found that the Board's decision was unreasonable in its consideration of the applicant's explanation for obtaining a Congolese passport. The matter was referred back to a newly constituted Board for rehearing and redetermination.
