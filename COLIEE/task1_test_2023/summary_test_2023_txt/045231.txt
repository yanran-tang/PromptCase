The case involves a mother and daughter from Nicaragua who claim they have a well-founded fear of persecution if they return to Nicaragua due to their political opinions and membership in a particular social group. The Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board determined that they were not Convention refugees. The applicants seek a referral back for rehearing before a differently constituted panel. The court concluded that the CRDD erred in not properly analyzing the conflicting documentary evidence and in improperly stating the test for Convention refugee status. The application was allowed but no question was certified.
