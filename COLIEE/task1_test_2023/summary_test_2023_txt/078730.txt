This case involves an application for judicial review of a decision by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board relating to a pension assessment for a former member of the Canadian Forces. The applicant had appealed the initial assessment which was denied but was successful on a later review by the Board with the extent of disability being assessed at 10% and a major aggravation of the condition connected to their service. The applicant now seeks to have the decision set aside and remitted to a differently constituted panel for a hearing de novo.This legal case involves an applicant who appealed multiple times for a higher disability assessment from the Veterans Review and Appeal Board. The Board initially assessed the applicant at 6% then raised it to 8% and finally settled on 15% after an additional appeal. The applicant argued that the Board failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision and should have conducted a hearing de novo. The court ultimately upheld the Board's decision and dismissed the applicant's appeal.
