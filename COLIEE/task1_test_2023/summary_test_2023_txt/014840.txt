The appellant Mohammad Hassan Modir Shanechi applied for citizenship in Canada but fell short of the residency requirement set out in section 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act. A Citizenship Judge refused his application and this is an appeal of that decision. The Federal Court found that the Citizenship Judge made four significant errors and remitted the matter back for rehearing by a different citizenship judge. The Court discussed the applicable standard of review and the Re Koo test which is used to assess residency requirements for citizenship.
