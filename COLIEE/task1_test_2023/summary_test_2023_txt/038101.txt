The applicant J. Russell filed for judicial review of a decision by the Canadian Human Rights Commission not to deal with his complaint against the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Russell alleged that the OPC mishandled his complaints against Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) and discriminated against him based on his sexual orientation and disabilities. The Commission determined that Russell's complaint was frivolous as it did not meet the requirements for discriminatory practices under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The court will consider the issues raised by Russell and will apply a reasonableness standard in its review.
