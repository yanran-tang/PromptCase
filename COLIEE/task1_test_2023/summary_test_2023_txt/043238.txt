The case involves an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which determined that the applicant was not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The applicant is a Tamil male from the North of Sri Lanka who claims to face persecution at the hands of Tamil militants and the Sri Lankan military. The Board found that there was no serious possibility of persecution and the applicant failed to establish that he belonged to a particular group at risk of persecution. The court dismissed the application for judicial review.
