An extended Hungarian family claimed asylum in Canada based on discrimination and persecution as members of the Roma community. The Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed their claim based on its conclusion that state protection is available to the Roma community. The family argued that the Board's conclusion was unreasonable as the measures taken to improve the situation of the Roma have failed. The Federal Court agreed that the Board's decision was unreasonable as it overlooked evidence showing that state authorities are unable to protect the Roma and their evidence about how the police responded to their complaints.
