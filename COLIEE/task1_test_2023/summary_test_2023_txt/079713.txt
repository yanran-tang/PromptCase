Subash Gurung a citizen of Nepal seeks judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which concluded that he is not a refugee or a person in need of protection. Gurung claimed that he fears persecution by the Maoists in Nepal due to his political opinions and pro-Tibetan activities. The board did not explicitly address his sur place claim and the court found this constituted a reviewable error rendering the decision unreasonable.
