The case involves the applicants seeking an order that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration along with six other individuals be held in contempt of court and for a declaration of refugee status. The applicants’ claim for refugee status had been delayed by the Immigration and Refugee Board which the judge found to be “special reasons” for an award of costs in favor of the applicants. However the judge did not award solicitor-and-client costs as such costs are only awarded in rare instances where scandalous or outrageous behavior or misconduct is demonstrated.
