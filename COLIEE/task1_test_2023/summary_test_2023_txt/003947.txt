A notice of motion for a confidentiality order was presented along with written submissions and a request for disposition without personal appearance. The respondents' solicitors argued that this should only apply to uncontroversial circumstances. Rule 324 allows for a motion to be disposed of without appearance and provides for written representations or oral hearings. The applicant's motion was deemed too complex and controversial for written disposition and was adjourned sine die. The respondents can make written submissions or apply for an oral hearing.
