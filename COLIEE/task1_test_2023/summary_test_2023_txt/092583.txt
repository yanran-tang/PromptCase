This case is an appeal of a decision by the Registrar of Trade-marks to expunge the trade-mark RENAMIN from the register due to lack of evidence. The applicant alleges not receiving the notice but the court accepts new evidence and finds that the trade-mark was in use in association with the wares for which it is registered. The appeal is allowed and the registration is reinstated.
