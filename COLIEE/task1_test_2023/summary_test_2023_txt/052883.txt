Mahmoud Saad a Lebanese citizen appealed a decision of a citizenship judge who refused his citizenship application because he did not fulfil the residency requirement set out in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act. The judge had applied two distinct tests to the applicant's residency which created confusion in the decision. The Federal Court allowed the appeal stating that so long as the citizenship judge properly applies one of the residency tests their decision will be considered reasonable. The court ruled that physical presence in Canada especially since subsection 5(1) of the Act gives the Minister little discretion is the key residency requirement.
