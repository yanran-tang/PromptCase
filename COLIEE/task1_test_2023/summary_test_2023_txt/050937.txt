The case concerns an applicant Master Mugadza who applied for judicial review after the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board found that he was not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The applicant claimed that he was targeted by the secret police in Zimbabwe because of his son's involvement in the opposition party. The Federal Court found that the Board erred in its interpretation of the standard of proof under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and ordered a new hearing before a different panel.
