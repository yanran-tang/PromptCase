A deportation order was issued against him but he appealed to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) and was granted a stay of removal with certain conditions including not committing any criminal offenses. However he was subsequently convicted of crimes referred to in s. 36(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) which automatically cancelled his stay and terminated his appeal under s. 68(4) of the IRPA.

The IAD cancelled Ramnanan's appeal and he applied for a judicial review.
