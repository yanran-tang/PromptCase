The applicant is seeking judicial review of the decision by the Registrar of Trademarks to give public notice of the respondent's adoption and use of the MILLENNIUM mark as an official mark for alcoholic beverages. The applicant owns a Canadian Registration for the MILLENNIUM mark and disputes the respondent's claim that they first adopted and used the mark in September 1998. The issues include whether an official mark can be expunged the timing of the respondent's adoption and use of the mark and whether the respondent is entitled to adopt a registered trademark as an official mark.The question of whether a trademark is confusing should be considered carefully and the decision of an expert in trademark matters should not be easily set aside. However if new evidence is presented that would have significantly impacted the expert's decision a court must review the decision on its own merits. This applies to the case at hand where new evidence shows the trademark in question was adopted and used by the respondent. The question is whether an official mark can be expunged through a court proceeding.
